    <title>D&amp;E Insight (1): What do we do in integration competence?</title>
    <url>/D&amp;E_Integration/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Integration is part of a product design process where a fabricated product need to be tested and qualified. When the test is done, the result is fed back to the function design teams as a go/no go decision. As an member in the integration cluster, you are expected to have a broad view of understanding on the product knowledge, you are responsible for giving a thought about the product performance with supportive evidences, and last but not least you need to define a simple metric to trace the improvement of product performance. With these three skill sets, you are in a good shape to handle the integration work.   </p>
<p><img src="/img/D&E/V_model.png" alt></p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>For the sake of explanation I would like to use my litho experience to explain how the above skill sets are implemented in the job. For the readers who are not familiar with lithography, this post could help understand more about the <a href="/complex-optical-system/">lithography system</a>. As a lithography machine manufacturer, a new machine will typically be released to the market every year. This machine, NXExxxx, could be just an upgraded version of the previously released one, which improves the imaging performance or the productivity. Since a new machine is already built in a factory, the integration groups need to test the machine according to a series of acceptance criteria to ensure the performance of this machine meets the specifications in the design sheet. </p>
<h1 id="Knowledge-Criteria"><a href="#Knowledge-Criteria" class="headerlink" title="Knowledge Criteria"></a>Knowledge Criteria</h1><p>A standard integration test sequence starts from the basic machine operation, such as loading and unloading the reticle, gradually moving to the wafer qualification to check the pattern printing quality. The pattern printing quality are tested not only in the nominal condition but also in the marginal condition to ensure that the machine has a good process window as well. Besides, customer relevant patterns are typically included in the qualification to safeguard the customer requirements.<br>As an imaging integration engineer, you need to have the litho knowledge covering from illumination, projection optics and wafer process. In each specific test, an imaging engineer should have a clear idea what is a good result and what is not. If something goes wrong, he or she needs to identify what should be the root-cause of the issue.</p>
<p>Another aspect is customer engagement. You can think that a lithography system is a 10 billion dollar working horse. Any customer who wants to jump into this pool would like to know whether this expensive consumption can be paid back in the future roadmap. Therefore, some exploratory work related to how lithography machines enable customer nodes also falls in the integration cluster’s responsibility. For the integration team members who are involved in the customer-relevant work, they should well understand customer node direction and requirement to see what are the potential knobs we could tune along with the lithography system to achieve customer goals. These potential knobs could be pattern design, mask stack, resist and machine tuning.</p>
<p><img src="/img/D&E/integration_context.png" alt></p>
<h1 id="Clear-storyline"><a href="#Clear-storyline" class="headerlink" title="Clear storyline"></a>Clear storyline</h1><p>The importance of integration cluster is to share consolidated suggestion. When you are debugging a machine test, you find out what would be the root-cause of this issue, then the next step is to convince the corresponding function cluster to accept this feedback. In the feedback discussion, your storyline should be clear to pinpoint <em>what the issue your are investigating</em>, <em>how did you do your analysis</em> and <em>what are the simulation and experimental results</em>. Addressing these three bullet points can make your story concise and powerful to reach your goal. The same approach could also be used for the customer engagement in which you need to address <em>what the goal we would like to achieve</em>, <em>how do we plan to do the study</em> and <em>what are the simulation and experiment results</em>. Be aware that you always need to have data to support everything you say in the story.</p>
<h1 id="Simple-metric"><a href="#Simple-metric" class="headerlink" title="Simple metric"></a>Simple metric</h1><p>The integration cluster usually needs to involve different parties in the discussion. The first thing you could imagine is how to keep focus in the discussion with a group of people with various technical background. Furthermore, a general machine qualification report has already consisted of complicated test items. Presenting a complicated story to the audience with large variety is easy to make them exhausted and inefficient. To avoid this embarrassing scenario, a simple metric for each qualification item is suggested. As soon as the audience look at the value there, they know immediately if the qualification result is OK/NOK.  </p>
<p>To simplify the shown metrics from multiples to one is a high skill-required job. You first need to make a stepwise flow chart to explain how the initial metrics transform to the final metrics. In each step, a clear definition and meaning of a metric and a calculation should be clarified, then the final metric should cover the outlook of the performance. As an example, the exposure latitude and depth of focus used in lithography is a simple metric to quantify the process window of a litho machine to specific patterns. In the daily litho engineering, there are more metrics needed in the machine qualification and customer engagement work.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>The integration cluster serves as a final checking point of a product development. The integration team does not design any hardware and software specifically but rather develop relevant knowledge and share the consolidated feedback to the product design and customers. You are expected to give concise message and address the questions properly from different stakeholders.            </p>

    <title>如何用理解式模型學好英文</title>
    <url>/Languages/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>我個人覺得語言是非常豐富多元的，但卻也讓人很掙扎到底應該使用哪中語言與他人溝通。同樣在這架設自己網站時，也面連到相同問題，最後我覺得還是以想要觸擊的使用者做依歸。對於科技和專案管理內容，以英文為主，至於海外工作心得則以中文為主。語言的學習是持續並進的，同時必須要有對等興趣作為陪襯才會學得快速。</p>
<h1 id="英文學習"><a href="#英文學習" class="headerlink" title="英文學習"></a>英文學習</h1><p>我想很多人對於如何學習外語，都發表了許多實用的想法。今天我就從理工的角度切入，分享我是如何邁進英文精進之路。首先應該了解到語言涵蓋了聽說讀寫四個部分，四者間的關係與各自對應到的技巧如同下表的關係:</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="聽說"><a href="#聽說" class="headerlink" title="聽說"></a>聽說</h2><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Listening</th>
<th>Speaking</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>1. 重訓: 讓自己習慣英語的語速 <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/60-second-science/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">[60-second science]</a> <br>2. 意象: 轉化內容成為腦中的圖像<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/60-second-science/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">[60-second science]</a>, <a href="https://tw.voicetube.com/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">[voicetube]</a> <br>3. 廣度: 增進自己在不同話題的聊天性</td>
<td>1. 概念發想: 思考自己想要訴說的概念<br>2. 段落組織: 串聯發展的概念，形成故事線<br>3. 熟悉的表意方式: 尋照自己欣賞說話形式</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>上半部的表格主要在解說聽說的層面，左右兩邊代表的是進(input)與出(output)，任何的語言的學習都是進與出的對應，兩者之間想輔相成。對於過去沒有特別習過聽英文的朋友，抓住對話節奏會有上手的困難，通常一開始的起點都會是聽力重訓，讓自己的耳多能習慣這個語言的節奏。練習的方式如下所列舉的步驟: </p>
<ol>
<li>聽懂大意</li>
<li>檢視文搞找出自己沒聽懂的單子和句子 </li>
<li>重播確認自己能掌握不熟悉的單字和句子</li>
<li>重播加速</li>
</ol>
<p>從我自己的經驗來看，這個階段大約需要經過一個月，你就會發現自己有能力抓住對話的方向。</p>
<p>當你自己發現已經可以抓住對話的方向，恭喜你已經可以邁向第二個階段了。這個階段是整個聽說模型建立的關鍵，好比你在使用中文和別人溝通時，你會在聽到別人說出一兩句話後，腦中就會開始出現相對應的影像。這樣聲音到意象的轉化也需要被建立在英文溝通上，進而幫助你在口語對話的能力。訓練流程的步驟基本如下，你可以在60-second science或是voicetube裡面選擇有興趣的教材來做練習。</p>
<ol>
<li>簡述內容<br>首先先將影片聽過一遍之後，試者將大意表達出來。一開始可能無法表達完整的影片內容，這是正常的。這部分的練習是在幫助大意的掌握。</li>
<li>將前述聽到的內容作分段做echoing<br>這個方法也被稱之為shadowing，也就是在撥放一句話後，思考自己所理解的意象，重複說出剛剛聽到的對話，如此一來聲音與意象形成連結。當整部影片你都完成這個流程時，代表你對影片的內容有很好的理解。</li>
<li>重播影片並將其概念再次闡術<br>將整部影片在重複撥放一片，然後講出裡面的內容，此時你會發現說出來的內容更具深度同時結構也很完整。這個練習並非一朝一夕可以達成的，一部影片可以拆分成幾天來練習，兩三個月之後你會發現你能夠自然地將心中的想法轉化出來。</li>
<li>重播之前的題材幫助自己複習意象<br>人類的大腦對於重複的意象可以形成長久的記憶，這會幫助你在未來對話或演說時，大腦自然而然地將相關情境和單字帶入相關的對話中。</li>
</ol>
<p>第三階段就是持之以恆的練習，當你建立了紮實的意象轉化，你就可以開始搜尋其他領域的影片來擴充單字量與慣用語。訓練上相信可以在第一遍時就掌握住大致的內容，然後針對不熟的句型做shadowing即可。半年之後，你會注意自己英語聽說水平明顯的躍昇。</p>
<p>最後關於口說能力，其實已經建構在聽說的模型之中，當你能夠將意象自由的轉化成語言時，這代表了口語已有了一定的基礎，剩下的是如何建立有條理的原創內涵。你所需要做的就是將分別的意象，已故事線的方式串聯起來，讓聽者能夠順者你的思緒來了解你的演講內容。如果你想成為有影響力的人，不妨參考Ted Talks看看有沒有你喜歡的表達方式。</p>
<h2 id="讀寫"><a href="#讀寫" class="headerlink" title="讀寫"></a>讀寫</h2><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Reading</th>
<th>Writing</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>1. 搜尋與分割: 快速的找尋自己所需要的內容 <br>2. 架構判斷對與分析: 解析作者的目的與各段落的功用 <br>3. 寫作風格(style)的臨摹</td>
<td>1. 概念發想 <br>2. 建立組織架構 <br>3. 語法與風格的淬鍊</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>上面的表格其實反映出讀寫的關係就之於聽說的關係，但乍看之下讀寫要練習的反而不多，其實不然! 讀寫的鍛鍊其實比聽說更加困難，真正的寫作是要在第三部份下非常多心思的。從工程與商業的角度來看，主要的需求是在第一與第二部分。你可以想像一下，如果今天你要在很多參考文獻中找出對你目前項目有幫助的資訊，你要做的第一件事就是善用關鍵字找到對應的內容，理解這段資訊在說些什麼，是不是符合自己的需求。</p>
<p>第二部分則是利用架構幫助自己了解掌握這篇文章輸出的概要，在哪裡可以找到自己的需求或是這片文章其實並不符合自己的需求。商業類別的文章不太像理工文獻都會有所謂的目錄，能夠自己解析出文章架構，也會對之後自己寫作有所幫助。常見的文章架構像是敘述、比較與因果，都有很明顯的架構提供辨別。</p>
<p>第三部分的風格含括眾多觀念,，其中3C(cohension, conherence and concision)的概念是埋值得推薦的，能夠讓你的文章內的想法凝於一體。有機會可以臨摹托福閱讀的文章了解一下這些如何敘述一個主題。</p>
<p>最後寫作就是將你的想法帶入適當的架構中，在每個架構下將其展開並搭配適當的風格，讓讀者能循者思維邏輯享受你的內涵。當然前面所講的內容比較偏向正式寫作，如果是與同事間平常的email往來，那就我手寫我口囉!</p>
<h1 id="英文能力整合"><a href="#英文能力整合" class="headerlink" title="英文能力整合"></a>英文能力整合</h1><p>再將學習過程拆分之後，接下來要將個別能力做整合，達到可以得心應手的境界。你可以想像語言的整合就好比腦中存在者太極的運轉，當新的資訊進入從外界進入時，腦中的理解模型將其消化成意象，而這意象友會激發腦中的思考，產生你所說的對話。藉由聆聽native speaker說話的內容，了解他們為何這樣說、如何說以及說些什麼，大腦內的迴路就會被刻劃成型。當下次有相同的情境出現時，你會自然而然的論述你想訴說的概念。寫作與對話的遵循相同的軌跡，只要你能拆分新進的內容，下次寫作時可以運用相同的手法，自身的寫作模式就會更加豐富。</p>

    <title>Towards PDEng-1: What is PDEng?</title>
    <url>/PDEng-1-professional%20doctorate/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is the first post of this series in which I will show you the overview of the PDEng program. PDEng program is placed at the 3rd educational cycle which requires the preliminary qualified study such as master degree to continue with. The aim of this program is to train you to be a Technical design expert who can solve complex technical problems by design and lead the design to be accepted by customers. More information regarding PDEng can be found on the <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/education/degree-programs/pdeng-programs/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">TUe</a> and the <a href="https://www.4tu.nl/sai/en/education/pdeng/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">4TU federation</a> websites. In this post, I would focus on the hard-core activities and what you can expect from the PDEng program.</p>
<h1 id="Program-roadmap"><a href="#Program-roadmap" class="headerlink" title="Program roadmap"></a>Program roadmap</h1><p><img src="/img/PDEng_roadmap.png" alt></p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>As an industry-oriented program, the roadmap shows a strong coverage of the necessary competences in the technical field. These competences will be developed in a two-year track with the conjunction of courses, workshop and projects. Each of them has its unique role to achieve your success in the technical field.</p>
<h2 id="Courses"><a href="#Courses" class="headerlink" title="Courses"></a>Courses</h2><p>People often get questioned here why I still need to do courses given the fact that I have already completed my master. The answer is very simple: there is no boundary in the technology development. When you step into a business area or a project, the task is typically not limited in a certain knowledge field but instead a multi-disciplinary challenge. Broad knowledge enables you to understand the team members’ thought and mitigate the interface barrier in the corporation. Besides, new techniques emerge every now and then. Keeping yourself up to date is still a valid argument for a successful business. </p>
<h2 id="Assignments"><a href="#Assignments" class="headerlink" title="Assignments"></a>Assignments</h2><p>It is easier said than done in most cases. Many people know how to give a nice speech about themselves but only few of them can address the issues when the challenges come. This of course ends up with a potential risk in the organization in which we are hardly promise deliverables to the customers. As a pragmatic technical expert, you are appreciated to ask for assignments to prove you are qualified on the future tasks. You should not panic about these assignment after all a master-level engineering person should be capable of performing fundamental analysis on the industrial questions. You should also treat these assignments as the entry record and then look back how much you grow from this entry level after completing the whole PDEng program.</p>
<h2 id="Design-activities"><a href="#Design-activities" class="headerlink" title="Design activities"></a>Design activities</h2><p>Design is a commonly used term or more precisely an abused word in industry. Any kinds of engineer seems to have an added <em>design</em> in their title even if their working contexts don’t match the design criteria. Design in technology should eventually solve the pain, which is placed in the middle of the problem-solving process. To achieve a solution-aimed design, a design procedure and the involved technique are powerful. You need to start from understanding customer requirements, linking their problem to the technology, showing how your method tackles the problem and finally verifying that the design works. The details in the design phase will be mentioned later.</p>
<h2 id="Project-based-management"><a href="#Project-based-management" class="headerlink" title="Project-based management"></a>Project-based management</h2><p>The problems we encounter in the industry can be downscaled to a monomer level but can also be upscaled to a system level.The complexity does not change the key property of a project that the frustration of a problem determines the project scope. Project is a framework which ramp up people, money, quality and time line to develop a solution. The control flow in a project is another important item to be aware: who are the stakeholders and when to report them. The detail flow will be elaborated in the following series.</p>
<h2 id="Personal-skills"><a href="#Personal-skills" class="headerlink" title="Personal skills"></a>Personal skills</h2><p>You need hard skills to cut off gold but you also need soft skills to get gold in the first place. In a multi-discipline industry, not everyone is on the same page as you is not a fresh news. You would need to explain what you think in a proper manner such that others can interact with your work. Your stakeholders are often too busy to listen to your update or to read your whole report. They just want you to tell what they want to know. You need to convince them your action is on the right direction. Personal skills, like art of presentation, industrial writing and personality reflection will help you on how to do when you are in these circumstances.</p>
<h2 id="Industrial-projects"><a href="#Industrial-projects" class="headerlink" title="Industrial projects"></a>Industrial projects</h2><p>Up to here you have read some terminologies used frequently in the technology filed but none of them will be yours if no practice is done on you. The industrial projects in the PDEng track offers you a chance to practice your learning. When you are involved in a company, you can see how people are busy in their workplace. You will discover there are still some places that they can improve in their process. Your initiative and effort will bring the additional value in the company’s success. The company’s content will be a trigger for your next journey.</p>
<p>In this post I tried to cover the full aspects inside a PDEng program. I will elaborate more on <strong>design</strong>, <strong>project managment</strong> and <strong>personal skill</strong> in the later posts. Thank you for your attention.  </p>

    <title>D&amp;E Insight (2): How to be productive?</title>
    <url>/D&amp;E_productiveWoW/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>D&amp;E(Design and Engineering) sector is a pillar in an enterprise. Almost all the product developments and customer engagement will go through the D&amp;E sector. D&amp;E integration cluster, an intersection point in company’s multi-business lines, is responsible to identify the critical value and steer the direction in the engagements. The amount of information and workload that need to be processed is massive, and we have to give our voice in time in order to guide the discussion properly. Therefore, being productive is essential for the D&amp;E integration cluster to meet the expectation from the outside world. There are three apsects in my opinion which could help be productive in overall D&amp;E organization.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h1 id="Modular-thinking"><a href="#Modular-thinking" class="headerlink" title="Modular thinking"></a>Modular thinking</h1><p>Problems and requests coming everyday seem to be new but they do have common patterns among each other. Modular thinking is a way to organize such massive amount of information inside our brain, which reduces the overhead and processing time for our brain capacity. This idea leverages the power of commonality and framework. For example, thinking about where the problems comes from could immediately identify the common patterns in the organization. Suppliers’ questions and requests are usaully associated to the discussion of product specifications. If a methodology and way of working are established, then we follow the same approach to estimate the impact of the suppelier’s change as well as to give the feedback to suppliers. Customers’ questions in general are more linked to understanding and solving issues. If a similar question has been asked, there might be already a solution available. Searching around and adapting the solutions to your problems makes life easier.</p>
<p>Modular thinking is not only just to identify the common patterns and swap the elements within the same module but also connect the dots between different modules in the framework. Taking the product improvement for example, a product improvment is normally initiated by customer request because of unsatisfication on the certain parts of product. To estimate if the change of product could meet the customer requestments, D&amp;E needs to predict the product performance based on the change of part. To ensure the change is executable, D&amp;E also needs to look internally to see if function clusters support this change, which could leads the conversation even to the supplier side. As a result, a product improvement is seen as a big work with many parties invovled. If someone could see the connection between different mouldes and know which change or outcome goes to where, it will speed up the process for final deliverables.       </p>

    <url>/new%20opening/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>想了許久或許是機緣已到，就決定開站了。很多人或許還在躊躇怎樣的開始，但對我而言做下去一切就會明瞭了。這個blog的目的就是希望能將自己過去的走跳經歷與想法分享出來，讓更多人能夠一起參與回響，期望下個美好科技時代的來臨。</p>
<p>回顧自己當初的選擇，這的確是個意外的啟發。這個啟發來自於同期預官室友的認真，讓本來沒有特別想要在國外闖蕩的自己重新思考這是否會是一個選項。當下的夜晚，開始在茫茫的網路上尋找自己下步該往哪去。一個倏忽即逝的片段在腦海中閃過，想起了曾經被告知的專業博士，新的旅程似乎又有再次開啟的跡象。</p>
<p>專業博士(PDEng)是近年歐洲興起的概念，源自於產學合作的發想，最終導引到產業的轉變與進步。對那個時候的我這是三個選項的其中一個，另外我也同時考慮了博士(phD)與工作的選項，以下就針對這三個做比較:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>選擇</th>
<th>專業博士</th>
<th>哲學博士</th>
<th>工作</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>優點</td>
<td>1. 業界實務導向 <br>2. 時程較短</td>
<td>1. 廣泛的內容選擇 <br> 2. 可以擁有名校的光環</td>

</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>在自身的興趣、背景與機會成本偏好的考量下，專業博士成為了我的選擇。一轉眼五年過去了，這些年的點點滴滴，我想值得我在之後娓娓道來。</p>

    <title>Towards PDEng-2: Technical Design Initialization</title>
    <url>/PDEng-2-technical%20design/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>As the overview shown in the series-1, design is a key activity in the PDEng track. I would like address what <strong>Design</strong> is in this post. Throughout history competitive companies are always looking into innovations to improve their business line. A schematic flow can simply explain how innovation works from the beginning to the end. </p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_innovation_process.png" alt><br>A company typically starts to find its own unsatisfaction from either its product performance, development cycle or manufacturing process. They need to understand why the problems are there. The problem can be things like defects in a product, bottleneck in the development cycle or bugs in a manufacturing process. Some of them can be found in a simple diagnosis, and others might need extensive research to understand the phenomenon. These are all in the discovery phase. The design phase can start when the problems are concrete. There are some powerful techniques, such as <strong>Modeling</strong>, <strong>Design Method for Development(DMD)</strong> and <strong>Design analysis</strong>, which will be introduced later to help the design process. After a solution is generated from the design phase, we can deliver it to the deployment phase in most marketing activities are involved. Design is clearly an inter-link between the problem and the end user. </p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h1 id="Modeling"><a href="#Modeling" class="headerlink" title="Modeling"></a>Modeling</h1><p>Modeling is a quite basic necessity in the design process. You need to have a model to represent the problem and with the model to demonstrate your solution is able to tackle the issue. A model can be as simple as a mathematic equation which only describe the relation between the input and the output. This model can further extended to a complex one which requires strong computation to tell you the the answer. For example, if a chef comes to you asking how he can cook a perfect boiled egg, you actually take this as a modeling exercise to propose a recipe to him. </p>
<p>Let’s start from a sketch to illustrate this problem. The picture shows a egg profile in 2D and specify the conditions which can meet the criteria of a perfect boiled egg. The model used in the boiled egg is the thermal equation. The important output from this model is the temperature distribution after a certain time. Depending on the procedure in the cooking process, the given input to this model will be different which leads to a different temperature distribution in space. To compute the outcome of this model, we usually run the FEM(Finite Element method) simulation using software like <a href="https://www.comsol.com/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">COMSOL</a>, but we can still do a back-of-envelope calculation to check if the simulation make sense or not. </p>
<p>In the 1D equation show in the figure below, it is straightforward to understand that the temperature of yolk after a certain time can be calculated from the initial medium temperature and distance between the contact point the surface of Yolk. Since the egg shape is an ellipse, it make sense to know that the temperature of the yolk along the short side and along the long side will be equal. You would need some special tricks to have uniform temperature distribution inside the entire egg.  </p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_modeling_example.png" alt><br><img src="/img/PDEng_modeling_equations.png" alt><br>The final recipe is involving several steps to make a perfect boiled egg which is out of the scope in this post. You should realize that any technical design problem can benefit from modeling. For the industrial project I have worked for, such as optical thin-film scattering, glass thermal process and the fancy AR glass, they all require modeling and yet even more than one model in a use case.</p>
<h1 id="DMD-Design-Method-for-Development"><a href="#DMD-Design-Method-for-Development" class="headerlink" title="DMD(Design Method for Development)"></a>DMD(Design Method for Development)</h1><p>When you receive a task, you usually receive a problem statement rather than a physical requirement. Multiple people are interested in your work. In this circumstance how are you going to manage their expectations? The first thing you need to do is to consolidate the problem statement to the customer requirements(demanding quality). These customer requirements can be further translated to the function requirements which are the technique area you plan to investigate. After you know what areas should be involved in your solution and what risk you will encounter, you are ready to discuss your thought with the stakeholders. Several useful tooling are introduced to assist you to manage the design flow.</p>
<h2 id="Stakeholder-chart"><a href="#Stakeholder-chart" class="headerlink" title="Stakeholder chart"></a>Stakeholder chart</h2><p>Design somehow is not a pure technical activity. Oftentimes it seems that people involved in the design process influence your work and design direction. Therefore, we need to mange our stakeholders’ expectation. stakeholder chart helps put your stakeholder into four categories which are clarified by importance and enthusiasm. Let me use my boiled egg as an example here. When you design a recipe to make a soft boiled egg, who do you think should be involved? The chef, the restaurant owner and customers, these people are called stakeholders in your design process. If we score them according to their roles, we will see a graph like below. You see that the chef is a quite significant stakeholder because the new recipe is interesting for him and has the strong impact on his menu. The restaurant owner seems also a key stakeholder in your work because he has the strongest influence on whether you would be able to keep developing this new recipe. Therefore, the recommend action from this chart is to suggest work closely with the chief and involve the restaurant owner for help if needed. For the rest, you can keep them informed for the progress.<br><img src="/img/PDEng_DMD_stakeholders.png" alt></p>
<h2 id="House-of-quality"><a href="#House-of-quality" class="headerlink" title="House of quality"></a>House of quality</h2><p>Typically after a problem statement has been consolidated to customer requirements, they are more than one you need consider.House of quality provides you with an overview of what the technical area you want to cover and how they relate to the customer requirements. Again the egg exercise is an example here. When a chef ask you to make a recipe for a soft boiled egg, this has already been one of the requirements; however, the restaurant owner could add his wishes to this recipe that the new recipe should take less than 1hr in the cooking time and can prepare at least 20 soft-boiled egg in each batch. With all these wishes, you can draw a house of quality diagram like this: the bottom left part is the customer requirements, and the top part is the functional requirements in which you will investigate to figure out the solution. Since you need to have a soft boiled egg within a limit amount of time, it make sense to investigate the thermal process control and the cooker capability. </p>

<h2 id="Failure-mode-and-effect-analysis-FMEA"><a href="#Failure-mode-and-effect-analysis-FMEA" class="headerlink" title="Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA)"></a>Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA)</h2><p>Design discussion should not only focus on what the requirements are and how the design goes but also not forget the risk analysis. Risk are those unwilling failure mode you will encounter in a design project and they would have different level of effect to the project. Monitoring those critical risks every month in the design process are necessary. Let me start from the FEMA table to see how we get those critical risk in the soft-boiled egg case. As we have already summarized the required function requirements in the house of quality, it is easy to think what the potential failure mode from each individual item. </p>
<p>For the thermal process, the potential failure mode can the non-realistic recipe generated from your modeling. The effect of this failure mode will severe because no soft-boiled egg can be produced by this recipe. Therefore, the action plan is to involve the chef to decide what is the acceptable cooking procedure in the kitchen. The other risk can be shortage of the egg that you simulated due to the chicken flue or other reasons. The action plan is to cover the tolerance of the egg in the simulation or to secure the supply channel of that particular type of egg. For the utility capability, there might be a chance that the utility we have or buy does not give the performance as we expected, which cause the problem of prepare soft-boiled egg in a large batch. We can mitigate this mis-expectation by doing the measurement for the utility performance first. After we combine the severity and the probability of the failure modes, we notice that main concern in this exercise is the recipe feasibility. With the proposed control action, None of the is risk should be worried. </p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_DMD_FMEAtable.png" alt></p>
<p>The DMD flow is a quantitative approach which governs the design work. The example we use here is just a simple use case but it pretty much demonstrates the value. In the industrial work the items in the list usually multiply, that is the reason why a quantitative approach will help you have a fair judgement.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>Technical design is a flow which aims to solve problems. It is not only a technical activities but with business awareness included. The starting point of technical design is customer requirements. Using the methods mentioned in this post can help you translate and manage customer requirements in your design.  </p>

    <title>專業博士 (PDEng)的初體驗(1)</title>
    <url>/PDEng-feedback/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>我在前面談到希望有機會能談談我自己在專業博士的心路歷程，今天終於有機會了。關於專業博士的介紹，請參閱我所寫的<a href="/PDEng-1-professional%20doctorate/">系列文</a>。我想在這篇分享的是在專業博士的體悟。記得剛來到荷蘭時，人生地不熟，英文也只是剛剛好，縱使有時Eindhoven天氣明媚，也無心思好好認識荷蘭女孩。進入學校時再次感受到久違已久的青春氣息，緩緩撲鼻而來，與我同一時間進入PDEng修行的是該所學校碩士畢業的高瘦荷蘭男生Nick。如果你曾經在異地生活過，你會知道有當地人作為嚮導，會解決生活中遇到的許多疑難雜症。</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h1 id="模組化思維"><a href="#模組化思維" class="headerlink" title="模組化思維"></a>模組化思維</h1><p>朋友就像一面鏡子能夠啟發你認知自己的不足。在我所屬的專業博士班學程裡，是有考核期的，在進入學程的半年後會有和老闆們go/no go的檢討會，回顧你在這半年所修的課與完成的assignments，看你是不是夠資個繼續留在program踏入最重要的industrial project。對我來說修課是相對容易的，畢竟歐洲的碩士課程架構非常接近，基本上ECTS高的課都會有不同背景的professors授課，該課程同時含有exercise,報告,實驗，最後的考試就是根據上過的課程內容，進行口試或是筆試。根據過去在瑞典chalmers university的經驗，這次的應對就相對輕鬆。真正惠我良多的其實是做業界的案子，在荷蘭似乎很重視團隊合作，因此很榮幸的能和我的荷蘭夥伴Nick一起工作。這次的案子是建立光學散射模的模型，用於預測太陽能電池提升的效率。一直以來我對於光學算是精深，畢竟在台灣從大學到碩班修了不少光學類別的課程，理論上相我應該能很精確點出這個案子的工作方向。但沒想到我這位機械熱學出身的同學卻能一語點出建立這個模型的關鍵，他對於我的驚訝，只表示他是從熱力學的觀念來代換理解電磁學的方程式，這才讓我才了解到何謂是模組化型的思考。以前的我會覺得說學術的知識要寫有一定的涵養才能夠解決問題，現在從Nick身上讓我看見我所缺乏的創意及橫向解決問題的能力，很高興能在這跨文化的合作裡，找到自己未來需要進步的能力。</p>
<h1 id="社交圈"><a href="#社交圈" class="headerlink" title="社交圈"></a>社交圈</h1><p>工作是生活的一環，社交也是其中一環。在台灣自認算是能言善道，可以從外太空聊到內子宮。到了荷蘭我發現外國人必我更加能講，講的還都是英文。我也許有能力在工作上與同事合作無間，但是談到喇迪賽與生活品味的涵養時，就覺得表現不夠自然。這也許和我過去專研於學術有所關係，溫文儒雅的我也許需要外界的啟發。隨者時間漸漸的推移，我已經開始和學校的同事一起到學校系館裡的酒吧喝酒閒聊。其實這是一個還不錯的機會，能了解每個不同文化背景的休閒與嗜好，總結來說，歐洲直率真誠，亞洲經典藏拙，美洲熱情奔放，俄羅斯瘋狂，這會是我對我不同同事們下的註解。最後想對自己說的是，應該有機會要好好的欣賞不同的音樂和從事一些體育競賽和活動，能幫助自己更能打入歐洲人的talking圈!</p>

    <title>The Organizational Blueprint: How Structure Fuels Corporate Success</title>
    <url>/organization-and-asml-success/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Organization is the bedrock of any successful company. It provides the essential framework that allows a business to leverage its resources efficiently, streamline communication, and foster effective collaboration. A well-defined organizational structure clarifies roles and responsibilities, ensuring that every team member understands how their work contributes to the company’s overarching goals. This alignment is critical for navigating the complexities of the modern business landscape and for scaling operations sustainably.</p>
<p>Without a sound structure, a company risks operational chaos, redundant efforts, and internal friction. In contrast, a thoughtfully designed organization empowers a company to be agile, innovative, and resilient. To see this principle in action, we need to look no further than ASML, a global leader in the semiconductor industry, which has mastered the art of organizational design.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<h3 id="ASML-A-Symphony-of-Organized-Excellence"><a href="#ASML-A-Symphony-of-Organized-Excellence" class="headerlink" title="ASML: A Symphony of Organized Excellence"></a>ASML: A Symphony of Organized Excellence</h3><p>ASML’s dominance in the high-stakes world of semiconductor lithography is not just a story of technological prowess; it’s a story of brilliant organizational strategy. The company has a unique way of organizing its operations, creating a synergistic environment where innovation thrives. This is achieved through a sophisticated structure that balances specialized expertise with cross-functional collaboration.</p>
<p>At its core, ASML is composed of several key sectors, each a center of excellence in its own right:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Development &amp; Engineering (D&amp;E):</strong> This is the innovation engine of ASML, where new ideas are born and transformed into the next generation of lithography systems.</li>
<li><strong>System Engineering (SE):</strong> This sector acts as the architectural backbone, ensuring that all the complex modules and components come together to form a cohesive, high-performing system.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Support (CS):</strong> More than just a service department, CS is a crucial partner to ASML’s clients, embedded in their operations to ensure machines are running 24/7 and to gather vital feedback for future improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Product Marketing:</strong> This team acts as the bridge between ASML’s technology and the market, defining the product roadmap and ensuring that ASML’s solutions meet the evolving needs of the semiconductor industry.</li>
<li><strong>Finance, HR, and other support functions:</strong> These departments provide the essential infrastructure and support that enable the entire organization to run smoothly and efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="The-Unique-Way-it-Operates"><a href="#The-Unique-Way-it-Operates" class="headerlink" title="The Unique Way it Operates"></a>The Unique Way it Operates</h4><p>ASML’s genius lies in how it orchestrates these different sectors. It operates on a principle of deep collaboration, both internally and externally. Cross-functional teams are standard, bringing together experts from D&amp;E, SE, and CS to solve complex challenges. This ensures that products are not designed in a vacuum but are developed with a deep understanding of manufacturing realities and customer needs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, ASML extends this collaborative model to its vast network of suppliers. By strategically outsourcing the manufacturing of many components, ASML can focus on its core competency: system integration and architecture. This creates a flexible and resilient supply chain that can adapt to the industry’s demands, while allowing ASML to remain at the forefront of innovation.</p>
<h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>An effective organizational structure is not a mere administrative detail; it is a powerful strategic tool. It enables a company to harness its collective talent, drive efficiency, and foster a culture of collaboration. ASML is a compelling example of this, demonstrating how a unique and well-executed organizational model can lead to sustained industry leadership. By creating a structure where specialized sectors like D&amp;E, SE, and CS work in close harmony, ASML has built a resilient and innovative organization that is far more than the sum of its parts.</p>

    <title>Towards PDEng-3: Technical Design Validation</title>
    <url>/PDEng-3-technical%20design/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is the part 2 of the design phase. For people who haven’t seen the part 1, please have a look. This will help you integrate the whole design flow.</p>
<h1 id="Design-analysis-and-development"><a href="#Design-analysis-and-development" class="headerlink" title="Design analysis and development"></a>Design analysis and development</h1><p>In a industrial work flow, there are couple of modules which are involved in a product/solution design. A complete design requires not only generating ideas but also verifying that idea as a workable solution. How do we evaluate if our idea works as we expected? You need to establish some sorts of experiments in which a clear analysis proves your point. Therefore, engineering statistics steps in into your experiments, which guides you what to do and how to analyze the results. A useful websites named <a href="https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Engineering statistics handbook</a> offers a completely overview for the experimental problems your will encounter in the engineering field. These problems can be categorized into several modules which are exploration, measure, characterize… etc. If any of them fit your current problem, have a look in the details. When you look into each category, you will notice that the approaches used in different categories are very similar because they were originated from the fundamental statics methods, such as data exploration, regression, variance analysis and design of experiments, for which another <a href="https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat500/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">online course website</a> is recommended to guide you step by step on understanding these statistics methods. In this post I will focus pretty much on the usage of design of experiment and design for six sigma and how these methods are incorporated into the design flow.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="Design-of-Experiments-DoE"><a href="#Design-of-Experiments-DoE" class="headerlink" title="Design of Experiments(DoE)"></a>Design of Experiments(DoE)</h2><p>DoE is a quite powerful skills in the data analysis. The fundamental concept is to tune the input parameters in an organized sequence such that the effect of each parameters in a process/model is known. Once the effect of each parameters is identified, we can know which parameters give the most dominant effect and use the DoE model to search for an optimized design.<br>Think about our nice egg exercise. Assuming in the previous modeling exercise the recipe has been generated as the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>put an egg in 200 degC water for 10 minutes and cool down the egg in the room temp 25 degC for 5 minutes </li>
<li>put the egg back to the 80 degC water for 5 minutes, then a soft-boiled egg is made.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you get a chance to test your recipe. What kind of experiments should I do? how to use the results to convince my stakeholders to accept this recipe? The experiments that you can run could have the following flow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up the objective of an experiment. In this case the objective is the temperature of the yolk. The yolk temperature should be well controlled such that it can still maintain liquid. </li>
<li>Determine a sampling plan for the design parameters. There are five parameters in this recipe, the first water temperature, the cooking time, the first cooling time, the second water temperature and the cooking time. We should set up an experiment to vary each of them one by one in order to know their effects.</li>
<li>Run the experiments and enter the result into the DoE software like Minitab or R to see what the effect of these parameters are.</li>
</ol>
<p>the expected outcome for this experiment would look like the following graph. We see that the most critical factors are the heating temperatures in those two steps. The cooling time has a non-linear effect to the final temperature. For the rest the impact is very limited. Therefore, you would need to well control these two factors, temp1 and temp2. The reason why multiple levels of a factor are taken into account is to cover the discrepancy of the simulation and the reality for these physical quantity and to understand the sensitivity of each factor.</p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_DoE_example.png" alt></p>
<h2 id="Design-for-Six-Sigma-DfSS"><a href="#Design-for-Six-Sigma-DfSS" class="headerlink" title="Design for Six Sigma(DfSS)"></a>Design for Six Sigma(DfSS)</h2><p>DfSS is a training which helps you to be familiar with the other common static methods used in the design analysis. These tooling are linked to the problems, such as process capability and stability, measurement system evaluation, design of experiments and reliability. The DoE method has been covered in the previous section. This section I would like to explain how to incorporate process capability in the design analysis.</p>
<p>So far I believe you have been pretty familiar with the recipe of cooking soft-boiled eggs. You have a good understanding about the recipe both in simulation and in experiment. What is still missing in the last mile? You need to show this recipe is capable of being used in the production environment (other restaurant staff are capable of making a successful soft-boiled egg using this recipe). Therefore, the last experiment you will do is to ask your colleague to cook soft-boiled eggs with this recipe and calculate what the Cpk value is.</p>
<p>The experiment could be done in this way: 1) cook at least five eggs per day with your recipe and measure the yolk temperature. 2) keep doing this for consecutive 25 days. The data will be a 25 by 5 dataframe. You can use X chart and R chart to analyze the temperature mean and range variation during these 25 days. There are some rules that a stable process need to comply with in the control charts. In our test case, all the data are within the control limit, meaning that the data itself has no extreme outliers.      </p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_controlchart_example.png" alt></p>
<p>Since there is no strange data in our dataset, we can continue the process capability analysis. In the previous section, we said that a good soft boiled egg should have yolk temperature around 80 degC. This number is our target, and we can accept +/- 5 degC variation in our product. According to this specification and our data, our recipe has the Cpk value 0.26, which actually suggest that this recipe is not capable of making a successful soft boiled egg in the production (typically Cpk value should be greater than 1.33). The main problem indicated the capability is the offset of mean which makes the whole distribution shift towards the left. We should try to find in which recipe step there was an added heat source. Besides, the temperature and cool time control in the process can still be improved to reduce the temperature variation. </p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_capability_example.png" alt></p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>In this series I explained what the verification role of design analysis and development is in the design phase. Two useful statistic methods were introduced, DoE and DfSS, which help you to know how to incorporate them into the design analysis. Linking to the previous series, <strong>Modelling</strong>, <strong>DMD</strong> and <strong>DAD</strong> together are the miniature of the design workflow. Although I used a simple toy case to demonstrate these concepts, they are scalable to the industrial work with different domain contents included.</p>

    <title>Towards PDEng-4: Project Management</title>
    <url>/PDEng-4-project%20management/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Often time we heard project project… floating around in the daily conversation. What exactly is a project and what people actually do in project management? These questions will be answered in this series. First, project is a collection of planed work that needs to be done in order to achieve a defined goal. The goal and the result of the project should be agreed with customers. If one would like to position the role of projects together with improvisation and routine, the table below shows the comparison among these three. In addition to the predictability of the result and the duration of work, the interesting thing is that commitment is also a feature which differentiates one from another. For any project, we must commit the result with customers and the result needs to be recognized by customers. </p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Improvisation</th>
<th>Project</th>
<th>Routine</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>1. unknown result <br>2. short term <br>3. commitment to the work</td>
<td>1. part of the result is known <br> 2. long term <br> 3. commitment to the result</td>
<td>1. the result is precisely known <br>2. duration can be infinitely long <br> 3. commitment to the procedures and the result</td>
</tr>

<a id="more"></a>
<h1 id="Project-pyramid"><a href="#Project-pyramid" class="headerlink" title="Project pyramid"></a>Project pyramid</h1><p><img src="/img/PDEng_project_pyramid.png" alt></p>
<h2 id="Project-result"><a href="#Project-result" class="headerlink" title="Project result"></a>Project result</h2><p>When we start to propose a project to a customer, it should comprise several important elements which reside in the project pyramid. The first important element is the project result. For any type of project that you start to work on, a clear definition for what project result should be delivered is crucial. How do we arrive to the project result?<br>Well, a very good approach is to start from the customer background. From there you will know what their business is aiming for, what the challenges they are facing now, and eventually why they need this result. One more thing that should be included in the project result as well is what not to be delivered, which defines the project boundary. With the above information in a document a clear project definition is ready.  </p>
<h2 id="Activity-plan"><a href="#Activity-plan" class="headerlink" title="Activity plan"></a>Activity plan</h2><p>The second element in the pyramid is the activity/phasing plan. When a project starts, there are several phases that will be gone through. The first one is the initiation phase in which customers and the relevant parties should be involved. The goal of the initiation phase is to make sure that everyone involved in the project shares the same view for the project size, what should be delivered and what not be delivered. The activities in this phase can be to investigate the overall and sub-goals, to decide if any preliminary study is required and to prepare the project documents. </p>
<p>When the initiation phase is clear, the next phase is the definition phase in which the specifications based on the project result should be consolidated. These specifications can be following requirements: </p>
<ul>
<li>the <em>working conditions</em> under which the product and the solution should be capable of working on</li>
<li>the <em>functional demands</em> that the product/solution should cover</li>
<li>the <em>operational demands</em> that the product/solution can provide to users</li>
</ul>
<p>From these demands, the work structure can be laid out in which several project activities can support each demand and link their relations with each other. These activities will be detailed in the design phase where people need to search for the design/solution to meet the demands. The outcome from the design phase should be the approved design. </p>
<p>With those design and solution in hands, we can proceed to prepare them. In this phase the activities will need to engage with the suppliers and the third parties to make sure that you will have their deliverables before execution.  Furthermore, instructing those who will execute the realization is another important activity.</p>
<p>Realization is finally the last mile towards the project result. keep your eyes on the execution and make sure the project is on track. Taking some time to prepare the technical documents for review is extremely important. If there are any customer feedbacks and wishes for maintenance or continuation, keep these activities in the follow up phase.</p>
<h2 id="Control-plan"><a href="#Control-plan" class="headerlink" title="Control plan"></a>Control plan</h2><p>The third element in a project is the control plan. Control plan is like a regulator which wires up the activities between and within phases. It would be hard to imagine what would happen if there is no control plan to regulate huge amount of activities in a project. Typically these controls are time, money, quality, information and organization. </p>
<p><strong>Time</strong> is a common factor in a plan in which all the tasks follows the time line. These tasks can be executed in sequence or in parallel. The critical actions of time control are:</p>
<ul>
<li>put expected time and margin on each task</li>
<li>indicate when the milestone would be expected and update</li>
<li>leave additional time for backup if deviation occurs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Money</strong> is the second factor which is as important as time. You will need to have the similar actions as shown in time control:</p>
<ul>
<li>estimate the cost and margin in each phase</li>
<li>know who can authorize the cost and when should update the overall cost</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quality</strong> is the third factor that should be included in the control loop. You should think about how to translate the progress of activities into how far we are to the demands and where should be the checking points to plan the reviews internally and externally. who should be involved in the review to secure the quality of the activity outcome. In such as way the ongoing project direction can be tracked and guided. </p>
<p><strong>Information</strong> is the fourth control factor. You need to update the progress of project to the stakeholders regularly. If there is any unexpected changes occurring, an update to the stakeholders is necessary. The following list can help you prepare the update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who produces the documents</li>
<li>Who get the information and who approves the information</li>
<li>How to deliver the information</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Organization</strong> is the final one in the control loop, which is related to the participants and parties. Based on the previous planned activities, it is time to place people and teams in these activities and show their responsibilities. Don’t forget the third parties such as suppliers and consultants in the control loop. The RACI model can help you identify their roles and responsibilities. If any team member is joining or leaving, or the task is transferring, the RACI table should be updated as well.</p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_project_RACI.png" alt><br>In the RACI table, it is suggested to assign only one “R” to each task in order to reduce ambiguity in a project and enhance working efficiency. “A” is the role who can authorize “R “ for go or no go decision.  </p>
<h2 id="Risk-analysis"><a href="#Risk-analysis" class="headerlink" title="Risk analysis"></a>Risk analysis</h2><p>Every project has its potential risks. If we can know them upfront, we can prepare the mitigation plan to reduce the impact of these risks. In general it is to good to have a brain storming session with the project team members to list what risk the team will encounter and make a table to evaluate the priority of each of them by taking probability and severity into account (You can reuse the <a href="/PDEng-2-technical%20design/">risk analysis approach</a> shown in the PDEng-2 post)</p>
<p>The options to diminish the risk with an action plan could be these four:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the plan to avoid the risk</li>
<li>Prepare a contingency plan for the risk, also known as “plan B”</li>
<li>Deflect the risk to another party</li>
<li>Accept the risk and do nothing</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>Project-based management is a frame work which requires some patience because the project plan will be modified several times when it is executed in the field. Understanding the overall project structure can help you adapt to the changes easily. </p>

    <title>Towards PDEng-5: How to present your ideas?</title>
    <url>/PDEng-5-presentation/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>If you have stayed in the technical industry for many years, you might hear this quote sometimes “We are always good at being a technical expert but we somehow need to sell our ideas to customers”. The technical industry is a business-based environment where any person who wants to realize its own marvelous idea needs to get approved by the market. How do we prepare ourselves to be ready for this demand? Do we have enough personal skills to convince our customers to accept the ideas? </p>
<p>Think about a situation where you were asked to give a presentation about your new technical findings tomorrow. You know that some major customers who come from different level sit under the stage waiting for your story. What the story are you going design such that they will follow your thought? How do you present your story such that customers will not get bored by your presentation? In this post I am going to show theatrical approaches which will help you communicate with your audience and construct the storyline.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h1 id="Art-of-presenting-science"><a href="#Art-of-presenting-science" class="headerlink" title="Art of presenting science"></a>Art of presenting science</h1><h2 id="Communication-in-theater-settings"><a href="#Communication-in-theater-settings" class="headerlink" title="Communication in theater settings"></a>Communication in theater settings</h2><p>Everyone basically knew how to talk to people when they were young. You must have had the chance to describe any of you idea to your classmates in schools but it seems that that kind of experience is not useful when it comes to business presentation. What cause the difference between the daily conversion and the presentation? Let’s start from identifying the basic elements which are included in our normal conversation. When you want to say something to people around you, you first notice that you have some sort of ideas and emotions inside your brain, for instance, you want to urge your friend to speed up because you are likely to miss the bus. You will move your head back to your friends and say “Hurry up!” with impatience. The message in the brain just took the body movement and the intonation to come out. This actually means that content and emotions need channels to slide to the audience. If your fiend is really aware of time, he will react to you immediately. An interactive communication just started. </p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_presentation_communication.png" alt><br>Let’s move the scenario back to the presentation. It seems like a familiar situation where you have to deliver message to the audience but now the distance between you and your audience is three times longer than normal. Furthermore, the audience may not be actively involved in your content. The first issue <em>distance</em> can be tackled by exaggerating the communication channels three times larger such that you are able to reach your audience. The second issue will partially be covered by exaggeration and could be completely addressed by the storyline. If we see these communications channels, almost all of them are strongly linked to emotion, which means your emotion can trigger the change of these channels. For example, if you are saying something which is really important, you could slow down the tempo, show a serious facial expression and lower the intonation, which can attract the audience attention that you are saying something significant. If you are listing how many achievement you made in this design, do not hesitate to use your gesture to count them and give the eye contact to the audience, this way you show your confidence to them. There are quite many channel sets I can make here for different scenarios but this will lead to a very long post. The rule of thumb of using theater settings is to observe how actors perform in theaters under such scenario, and try to project their way of communication to the presentation. I believe this way of presenting can make your presentation more attractive and powerful.    </p>
<h2 id="Constructing-storyline"><a href="#Constructing-storyline" class="headerlink" title="Constructing storyline"></a>Constructing storyline</h2><h3 id="Why-stories"><a href="#Why-stories" class="headerlink" title="Why stories"></a>Why stories</h3><p>I just briefly touched the point of the theatrical approach which is used to emphasize your emotion to reach the audience. Still we would like to keep our audience’s attention and make sure they can stay with our journey until the end. As human beings we know that we like stories because we could emerge ourselves to the story to feel what the adventure the characters are experiencing. we could attract our audience with a similar approach that is creating a well-structured story in the presentation. Let’s first explore what the basic elements a attractive story should have.</p>
<p>Stories are about people. Think about the time when we read a story, what is the first thing we are looking for? the <strong>character</strong>. characters will generate <strong>actions</strong> which make the story vivid. When we see the characters carry on these actions, what will trigger us to keep an eye on is the <strong>adventure</strong>. Only exciting stories can attract viewer’s eyes. But since we like to experience adventures in a safer environment, we also hope the character can manage <strong>danger</strong> in their journey. There will be a certain period that the characters need to wait until the they come up with a <strong>solution</strong>. The bold parts I just labeled are the basic element that should be included a good story. If I would summarized what a good story is in a single word, that is conflict:</p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_presentation_storyelement.png" alt><br>Only when people want to do something but are unsure whether they could succeed could really triggers tension. Audience will be curious about the ending.</p>
<h3 id="Story-phases"><a href="#Story-phases" class="headerlink" title="Story phases"></a>Story phases</h3><p>To create a story with conflict, a useful story phasing is introduced in the picture below. The first phase is the <strong>exposition</strong> where you would describe your main characters and the background of this story. Without the exposition people cannot identify the character and will not worry about the conflict in the story. In other words, they cannot catch you. Another aspect in the exposition is to control the size of the story. If you have a short story, like only one improvement in your study, then make a small world such that people can focus on the conflict you encounter later. If you have a large story, for instance, several milestones have been achieved in your project, you should create a larger world to ensure those conflicts have the room to flourish. Exposition does not need to cover any conflict. It is a preparation state for the motorical moment.</p>
<p><strong>Motorical moment</strong> is the event moment when you reveal the conflicts. The conflict should give people anxiety, which make people want to see how it continues. The conflict should not be too simple to be negligible but also not too huge to kill the audience’s expectation. </p>
<p>After revealing the conflict in the motorical moment, you start to take actions in the <strong>Divergent action phase</strong>. As previously described in the motorical moment, your audience has already expected that the conflict is challenging. Therefore, you will not immediately discover the solution in this phase. You will first take some actions which lead you away from the solution, or these actions may even guide you to the wrong direction, which cause the excitement and tension in the audience sensation. These divergent actions for scientific stories can be the realization of some initial ideas which did not work out in the end. The purpose of showing this experience until the crucial event coming is to confirm the challenge you set in the story.</p>
<p>The crucial event is the moment when something happens which makes the solution of conflict possible. After this event your actions will be redirected to the right direction which goes to the solution. Remember the crucial event is very short and distinguishable. It can just be an insight or thought which dramatically changes the direction of the story.</p>
<p><strong>Convergent action phase</strong> is following the crucial event, which covers the activities pointing towards the solution. In this phase you can arrange faster tempo which shows confidence to audience that we are on the way to the solution. In the end they see the <strong>Solution</strong>.</p>
<p>After you have solved the conflict in the solution phase, there is still one more phase called <strong>Coda</strong> where you can make sure there is nothing happened after the solution phase. The statement can be every one is happy with the result or stakeholder is satisfied with the finding. It is an indication for the audience to notice that this is the end of the story.</p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_presentation_storyphases.png" alt></p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>In this post I have already introduced what theatrical approaches are and how to use them to address your presentation. Of course, nothing will be more beneficial than a hands-on practicing. After you see this approach, you should try to do some pitfall trainings on your presentation. Writing a story line before practicing can give you more feeling about what you want to say in the presentation. If you are interested in to get some feedback, perhaps I can give some guidance on it.</p>

    <title>Technical Insight (1): A complex optics giant - Lithography System</title>
    <url>/complex-optical-system/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Optics is awesome. The reason why we can see this world is because of light shining on the surface of objects around us. Light does not only help us know what those objects are but could also be a carrier in internet connection. I have chosen optical engineering as my career for quite some years. During my career, I’ve seen many interesting applications popping up from this fundamental physics. What still drives me to continue this journey are those art of engineering applications which are facilitated by complex optical designs. If you would like to have optics working in your device, your instruments or your network, you have to design a system to serve your purpose. Among these optical applications Lithography system seems to be one of the most complicated giant in the industry. Let’s see how we can breakdown this giant monsters into the basic modules to further understand how it works.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<h1 id="Fundamental-of-lithography-system"><a href="#Fundamental-of-lithography-system" class="headerlink" title="Fundamental of lithography system"></a>Fundamental of lithography system</h1><h2 id="Semiconductor-process-and-Litho"><a href="#Semiconductor-process-and-Litho" class="headerlink" title="Semiconductor process and Litho"></a>Semiconductor process and Litho</h2><p>Lithography is perhaps your first time to hear this word but is not a fresh word in the semi-conductor industry. If you visit any semi-conductor fab today, you would see many lithography systems heavily be used in the manufacturing process where lithography plays a role to define tiny patterns to be printed on the wafer. The picture below shows the where the lithography is implemented in the semiconductor process cycle. Before a wafer is sent to the lithography system, several preprocessing are needed such as, polishing, deposition and resist coating. After litho exposure(step 5), the wafer will be etched and ion-implemented. Then this wafer can continue its second cycle to have the next layer built on top of it. These fabrication cycles will usually repeat at least 20 times depending on the chip applications. </p>
<p><img src="/img/Complex_optics/LithoProcess.png" alt></p>
<h2 id="Lithography-system"><a href="#Lithography-system" class="headerlink" title="Lithography system"></a>Lithography system</h2><p>Since we know the lithography system plays an important role in chip fabrication process, why not just open this secret box to look how it works inside. The graph below on gives you an overview of how a frontier EUV system design looks like. This system can be generally broke down into three main modules which are already labeled in the graph, plus some additional assistant modules like cooling, power supply and air control… which are not indicated in this graph. For the track module you can interpreted it as a kind of IO interface towards the outside world. The reticles and the wafers will be loaded and unloaded via the track. This track system is usually interconnected with the fab pipeline in production. For the stage module, it manages the internal wafer flow. Before the wafer be placed under the projection box, the wafer topography must be measured and sent to the lithography system as the pre-alignment information. The final one is the optical module which governs the photon’s life from the beginning to the end. The detail of the opical module will be explained in the next session.</p>
<p><img src="/img/Complex_optics/lithography_system.png" alt></p>
<h2 id="Lithography-optics-module"><a href="#Lithography-optics-module" class="headerlink" title="Lithography optics module"></a>Lithography optics module</h2><p>Lithography optics module consists of several sub modules, including source, illumination and projection. A simple way to understand the lithography optical module is to interpret it as a projector. Just imagine you need light to shine on the mask and this mask image needs to be demagnified and projected onto the wafer. The EUV light comes from the source vessel which generates EUV using laser and plasma. The mechanism of generating EUV source is out of scope of this post because we would like to concentrate on the scanner system. As the EUV light moves forward to the illumination module, the light will be modulated by the field facet mirrors which decides which pixel in the pupil plane will be switched on and which of them will be switched off. These pixels map to the illumination angles with which the EUV light shine on the reticle. The light will be diffracted by the reticle towards the projection optics module. As a result, the tiny grating patterns on the reticle will print on the wafer. </p>
<p> <img src="/img/Complex_optics/lithography_OpticsModule.png" alt></p>
<p> Mirror optics perhaps is not straightforward for most optical designers. Thereby, a lens-based optics module is shown in the next graph to explain some basis. In the lens-based illumination module, we see field facet lens array are included in the illumination design. The purpose of using field fact lens array is the same as using field facet mirror array, which is generating the pixel source point in the pupil plane. The DOE(Diffraction Optics Element) group prior to the field facet lens group functions as a modulator to control which facet lens would be illuminated. In short, the concept of the lens-based illumination module is entirely implemented in the EUV mirror-based illumination module. The limitation in EUV mirror optics is the freedom of the pixel choice. The relay optics provides additional knobs to fine tune the illumination performance on the reticle.</p>
<p> Projection optics is commonly seen ın an optical design. This design consist of an object plan, pupil plane and the image plane. Reticle would be placed at the object plan, and the light will be diffracted by the grating-type of patterns towards the projection system. In order to print these tiny features, at least the 0th order and the first order of the diffraction light must be captured by the projection pupil. As a result, the minimum printable pitch <em>dwafer</em> was predetermined by the pupil’s numeric aperture(NA) at wafer level(assuming the illumination angle is zero). However, the default minimum pitch is not small enough to cover today’s semiconductor feature size. We have to introduce off-axis illumination in the projection optics. This way we manipulate the diffraction angle of a gratting pattern such that at least 0th order and either +1 or -1 order can be captured by the projection pupil. This resolution enhancement technique(RET) is absorbed by the factor k of the formula in the graph. Knowing how to choose an optimum illumination pupil is a key to enable the pattern nodes in the lithography.           </p>
<p><img src="/img/Complex_optics/lithography_Optics.png" alt></p>
<h1 id="Lithography-system-performance-modeling"><a href="#Lithography-system-performance-modeling" class="headerlink" title="Lithography system performance modeling"></a>Lithography system performance modeling</h1><p>As you have already seen in the pictures above, a lithography system is a complex giant box. You need a robust model to qualify and quantify the system performance. Although the system is working in the free space, we still need some finite element analysis when the light interact with the nano structure on the reticle. The entire modeling of a lithography system requires three simulators to complete imaging analysis when EUV light travels to mask, pupil and resist respectively.</p>
<h2 id="Raytracing"><a href="#Raytracing" class="headerlink" title="Raytracing"></a>Raytracing</h2><p>Raytracing serves an integrated method to cascade the simulation results at different stages. When the light starts from the illumination source, it can be treated as an incoherent light source. The contribution of each individual pixel in the illuminated source could add up linearly in the final stage. As described in the formula below, each individual ray from the source has its mask transfer function, projection transfer function and the resist transfer function which modulate the wave amplitude and phase. With the contribution from each pixel, raytracing is a feasible approach to take care of the needs of each individual ray in the overall system modeling.</p>
<p><img src="/img/Complex_optics/raytracing_illumination.png" alt></p>
<h2 id="Mask-Modeling"><a href="#Mask-Modeling" class="headerlink" title="Mask Modeling"></a>Mask Modeling</h2><p>lithography mask is a multilayer film stack which allow certain bandwidth of light spectrum to transmit (or reflect from) the mask. On top of film stack there is a pattern layer which consists of a bunch of nano gratings such as dense line space, isolated line space and regular array. To understand the basic diffraction behaviour, a flat mask could be assumed, which is subjected to Kirchhoff’s diffraction formula to calculate the diffracted wave. The absorber within the pattern layer could modulate the light amplitude and phase, which determined the transmitted near-field from a mask. However, Kirchhoff’s formula is just an approximation of the real field. When the wavelength is at the same scale as the grating period, wave property is strongly dominant. Hence, a rigorous computation via maxwell equation is generally used to analyze the transmitted near filed from a mask. These rigorous methods are related to RCWA, FDTD and FEM approaches. Please see the figure below for the difference between Kirchhoff and rigorous method. </p>
<p><img src="/img/Complex_optics/mask_modeling.png" alt></p>
<h2 id="Projection-and-Aberrations"><a href="#Projection-and-Aberrations" class="headerlink" title="Projection and Aberrations"></a>Projection and Aberrations</h2><p>As briefly mentioned in the previous session, the easiest way to interpret a lithography system is to think it as a projector. The information on a mask needs to be projected onto a wafer, thereby a high contrast image is expected at the wafer level. We could use free space optics to analyze the image performance at the wafer level. Fourier optics is a good approcah to calcuate wave propagation from the transmitted near filed to the final image plane. </p>
<p>The resolution of image is limited by the diffraction limit in an ideal system. Shorter wavelength and larger numeric aperture are keys to reach smaller resolution. In addition to the diffraction limit, a real optical system also suffers from aberrations, intensity inhomogeneity and mechanical vibration. The first two system imperfections are modeled in the pupil plane as an intensity and phase modulation for the incoming propagated wave, where as the vibration is treated as the variety of tilt and focus in the system tolerance.</p>
<p>How to characterize aberrations properly is always an important question in the litho simulation. Unlike intensity inhomogeneity, aberration is less likely an arbitrary distribution in space, rather it is the outcome of the projection module design. As a result, litho engineers like to use Zernike polynomials to describe any aberration because they are orthogonal and are linked to the optical effect in projection. The table below shows the zernike polynomiasl up to Z64. They can be arranged in such an way that each columns could correspond to an aberration family that we are familar with in optics. For instance, spherical aberration will cause the image defocus, coma will cause the variety of magnification (center shift) over the entrance pupil, and astigmatism will cause different focus position for different patter orientation.</p>
<p><img src="/img/Complex_optics/aberrations.png" alt></p>
<h2 id="Resist-chemistry"><a href="#Resist-chemistry" class="headerlink" title="Resist chemistry"></a>Resist chemistry</h2><p>Resist is a photon-sensitive layer deposited on a wafer as a pattern-defined precursor for the subsequent etch process. The ADI (After-Litho-Image) quality is related to the aerial image quality and resist chemistry. When the photon comes into the resist, the photon will diffuse in the resist, causing the image to be blury. There are several models which are used to estimate the diffusion impact on imaging, such as blur model and image threshold model. The graph below gives more detail explanation for these two models.</p>
<p>Antoher aspect could be added into the resist modeling is to consider the chemical reaction in resist. Since PAG(photon-acid generator) convert photons to acid, the diffusion area of acid would decide the image boundary. If a different developing process is used, it will give a different impact to the final image.                               </p>
<p><img src="/img/Complex_optics/resist_modeling.png" alt></p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>Lithography is a real complicated ginant machine which took many years to be developed in industry. The litho process functions as an <em>eye</em> in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Without any pattern resolved in the resist, it is not possible to proceed with the subsequent steps. The imaging performance relies on a sophisticated and cascaded modeling which involves the knowledge in mask, projection and resist chemistry.</p>

ASML has sectors such as D&amp;E, SE, CS, product marketing, finance and HR. It has a unique way to organize the operation.</h1><p>Can you write a blog post for it? first talk about what organization organization would and how organization can help company development, and then use asml as example to support this point?</p>
<p><strong>The Power of Organization in Driving Company Success: Lessons from ASML</strong></p>
<p>Organization is a fundamental pillar for any company aiming for long-term success. When a company is well-organized, it can leverage resources more efficiently, streamline decision-making processes, and foster better collaboration among teams. Effective organization ensures that everyone understands their roles, goals are aligned across departments, and communication flows smoothly — all crucial factors that enhance productivity and innovation.</p>
<h3 id="Why-Organization-Matters-for-Company-Development"><a href="#Why-Organization-Matters-for-Company-Development" class="headerlink" title="Why Organization Matters for Company Development"></a>Why Organization Matters for Company Development</h3><p>A clear organizational structure provides a framework within which a company can operate optimally. It helps avoid duplication of efforts, reduces confusion, and accelerates problem-solving by defining clear responsibilities. Beyond internal efficiencies, a strong organizational setup facilitates adaptability — enabling companies to respond quickly to market changes, customer demands, and technological advances. Ultimately, good organization empowers a company to scale sustainably and maintain competitive advantage.</p>
<h3 id="ASML-A-Unique-Organizational-Model-Driving-Innovation"><a href="#ASML-A-Unique-Organizational-Model-Driving-Innovation" class="headerlink" title="ASML: A Unique Organizational Model Driving Innovation"></a>ASML: A Unique Organizational Model Driving Innovation</h3><p>ASML, a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing technology, exemplifies how smart organizational design can fuel growth and innovation. The company’s operations are divided into distinct sectors, each focusing on a critical aspect of the business: Development &amp; Engineering (D&amp;E), Systems Engineering (SE), Customer Support (CS), Product Marketing, Finance, and Human Resources (HR).</p>
<p>This segmented yet interconnected structure allows ASML to leverage specialized expertise within each unit while promoting cross-sector collaboration. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Development &amp; Engineering (D&amp;E)</strong> focuses on advancing the core technology and product innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Systems Engineering (SE)</strong> ensures the seamless integration of complex systems into practical solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Support (CS)</strong> maintains strong client relationships, ensuring tailored assistance and satisfaction.</li>
<li><strong>Product Marketing</strong> links customer needs with technical capabilities, guiding strategic market positioning.</li>
<li><strong>Finance and HR</strong> provide the operational backbone by managing resources, budgeting, recruitment, and talent development.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASML’s unique organizational approach promotes efficiency by clearly delineating responsibilities and fostering collaboration through coordinated cross-sector initiatives. This blend of specialization and teamwork enables ASML to remain at the forefront of semiconductor technology while optimizing resource use and driving continuous improvements.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>A well-designed organizational structure is much more than a hierarchy chart; it is a strategic tool that propels a company’s development by aligning resources, expertise, and efforts toward common goals. ASML’s example demonstrates how specialized sectors working cohesively can create a powerful engine for innovation and success. Businesses aiming to thrive in competitive landscapes should pay close attention to how they organize their operations — it might be the key that unlocks their full potential.</p>

    <title>Towards PDEng-6: Understand yourself and others</title>
    <url>/PDEng-6-selfreflection/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Do you believe that you are unique in the world? Do you truly know who you are? In today’s collaborative society we are not only busy with our own tasks but also at some point we need to team up with other members in order to grow up and to achieve success. You might have a list of people you are in favor of within an organization and perhaps also a black list of people you don’t like. But what if you have no choice but to work with unfavored people, how to ensure a peaceful working relations? In this post I would like to guide you on knowing who you are in a <strong>learning cycle</strong>, how to keep good <strong>communication</strong> with others, how to give other <strong>feedback</strong>, and most importantly how to maintain good <strong>working relations</strong> based on who you are. Before we deeply dive into some soft skills, let’s first explore ourselves.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h1 id="Learning-cycle"><a href="#Learning-cycle" class="headerlink" title="Learning cycle"></a>Learning cycle</h1><p>Below the graph shows the learning cycle of human beings. What do you think where you are in the cycle? Some people think they are theorists while others think they are pragmatists. Take me for example, I recognize that I have a mixed type of theorist and pragmatist spirit, meaning that I like to think about the overall structure before I start to work on a topic. I like to have a system level overview to know why I need to do this work. After I thought about the general flow, I like to realize it to see if it works as expected. However, if somebody just asked me to do a work without thinking further ahead, it would be difficult to motivate me to execute that action. The purpose of identifying yourself in a learning cycle is to notice what your future development can be. The actions can be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the most suitable position to boost your growth. In other words, you should search for the position which matches your native mode. This way you can maximize the potential. </li>
<li>Be aware of your pitfalls when you are in the native mode. For example, sometimes theorists over think the problems without putting them in actions. In the end this has a risk to deliver the outcome on time.  </li>
<li>Try to play different roles if there is a chance coming. There will be different roles that you will see in your career path. If you want to broaden your view, experiencing these different roles definitely helps. However, not all of these roles would perfectly match your natural mode. Therefore, picking up that missing spirit to close the gap is something worth learning. </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng/PDEng_selfreflection_learningcycle.png" alt></p>
<h1 id="Communication"><a href="#Communication" class="headerlink" title="Communication"></a>Communication</h1><p>Have you ever experienced one thing that when you are saying A but your colleagues answer you in B? Or when you are trying to explain what your point is on this issue, he still gets stocked to understand you correctly. If you have seen these many times, then “yes” you just suffered from the communication problems. If you see the picture below, you know the communication itself is just a coding and decoding process. How to ensure you understand and they can understand you as well? The approach I can share with you is <strong>LSD</strong> which stands for the three following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen: When someone is saying their opinions, try not to interrupt their speaking. The same holds the other way around. If your colleague just interrupted you, ask him to first let your finish your statement.</li>
<li>Summarize: Try to summarize what other people’s statement to make sure your interpretation is in line with his thought.</li>
<li>Dig deeper: When there is any confusion between your conversation, do not hesitate to ask any question to clarify what they just meant.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng/PDEng_selfreflection_communication.png" alt></p>
<h1 id="Feedback"><a href="#Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Feedback"></a>Feedback</h1><p>When you are working in an organization, have you ever noticed that some colleagues’ behaviors bring benefits to an organization while some of them bring disadvantages to you and the organization. Is there any way that we can shape our working environment towards a positive and competitive one?. Perhaps it is time to give feedbacks to the people around you. Giving feedback is an art, namely, we should not destroy the working relations between each other due to feedback. Here are some remarks when you are about to give feedbacks.</p>
<ul>
<li>make your statement descriptive not qualifications. Try to describe your perceptions.</li>
<li>link your perception to a specific situation and behavior. Focus your perceptions on the situation and the behavior, not the person itself.</li>
<li>select neutral words for the description.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, feedback is not only one way but can also come from the other way. When you receive the feedback from others, perhaps these remarks can help you digest other people’s gift better.</p>
<ul>
<li>listen carefully and summarize. The purpose is to understand their feedback correctly. If needed, you can also ask questions to clarify the part which is unclear for you.</li>
<li>accept the present and no defense. This way you show you will take this seriously.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might ask why we need to accept feedbacks and how the feedback will help us? The graph below is a matrix which is how you know about yourself and how other people know about you. Feedback is a gift which enables us to unlock our potential. As we are human beings, sometimes we will not see our blind points. If others can point it out, you will recognize it and develop that potential afterwards. On the other hands, self revelation is a direction in which you show people your ability and competence. This direction can make you more visible in an organization and therefore you will have more chance in the future. If you can successfully develop your blind spots and make them visible to others, you do not only gain this competence yourself but also give the impression you have unlimited potential to invest in, making your career more successful. </p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng/PDEng_selfreflection_feedback.png" alt></p>
<h1 id="Good-working-relations"><a href="#Good-working-relations" class="headerlink" title="Good working relations"></a>Good working relations</h1><p>In an organization we all have to drive our own business values to success. Under this process we should realized that We have different interests, values and needs with some people or groups, which could sometimes cause conflicts with other people. How good the working relations you can create depends on how you handle the conflict with others. Your attitude could result in the five scenarios as described in the figure below. If we always force the direction towards only to our side, perhaps the conflict will still come back with even larger amplitude. For ourselves, it is not acceptable to only sacrifice our interests for a long period time because this will only lead to frustration on the work. Since we are smart people we know that we should maximize the benefit on both sides. However, what are the tips that we can follow to realized a win-win outcome?</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, you need build up confidence and trust. You should be honest about what is important for you and understand what is the importance for others. In other words, not to exaggerate what both sides actually need. Otherwise, distrust can be the obstacle to block your communication.</li>
<li>Secondly, be creative to find the connection between two sides and think about how the differences can be addressed.</li>
<li>Thirdly, make good use of the communication skills you just learned</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course you need a mirror to reflect what your current altitude is for solving these conflicts. Some questionnaires would help you to achieve this. Please feel free to search for them online.</p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng/PDEng_selfreflection_workrelation.png" alt></p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>In this post I have mentioned several topics related to your soft skills. These soft skills are very generic but very important in a group because success is not evaluated on a single person but on the whole unit. If you would like to have smooth career path, you might need to join some really hands-on trainings to practice these soft skills. For people who are interested more on the personality analysis and collaboration, MBTI type indicator is a good methodology to look into.</p>
