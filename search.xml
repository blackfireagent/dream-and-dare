    <title>Towards PDEng-1: What is PDEng?</title>
    <url>/2020/07/18/PDEng-1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is the first post of this series in which I will show you the overview of the PDEng program. PDEng program is placed at the 3rd educational cycle which requires the preliminary qualified study such as master degree to continue with. The aim of this program is to train you to be a Technical design expert who can solve complex technical problems by design and lead the design to be accepted by customers. More information regarding PDEng can be found on the <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/education/degree-programs/pdeng-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TUe</a> and the <a href="https://www.4tu.nl/sai/en/education/pdeng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4TU federation</a> websites. In this post, I would focus on the hard-core activities and what you can expect from the PDEng program.</p>
<h1 id="Program-roadmap"><a href="#Program-roadmap" class="headerlink" title="Program roadmap"></a>Program roadmap</h1><p><img src="/img/PDEng_roadmap.png" alt=""></p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>As an industry-oriented program, the roadmap shows a strong coverage of the necessary competences in the technical field. These competences will be developed in a two-year track with the conjunction of courses, workshop and projects. Each of them has its unique role to achieve your success in the technical field.</p>
<h2 id="Courses"><a href="#Courses" class="headerlink" title="Courses"></a>Courses</h2><p>People often get questioned here why I still need to do courses given the fact that I have already completed my master. The answer is very simple: there is no boundary in the technology development. When you step into a business area or a project, the task is typically not limited in a certain knowledge field but instead a multi-disciplinary challenge. Broad knowledge enables you to understand the team members’ thought and mitigate the interface barrier in the corporation. Besides, new techniques emerge every now and then. Keeping yourself up to date is still a valid argument for a successful business. </p>
<h2 id="Assignments"><a href="#Assignments" class="headerlink" title="Assignments"></a>Assignments</h2><p>It is easier said than done in most cases. Many people know how to give a nice speech about themselves but only few of them can address the issues when the challenges come. This of course ends up with a potential risk in the organization in which we are hardly promise deliverables to the customers. As a pragmatic technical expert, you are appreciated to ask for assignments to prove you are qualified on the future tasks. You should not panic about these assignment after all a master-level engineering person should be capable of performing fundamental analysis on the industrial questions. You should also treat these assignments as the entry record and then look back how much you grow from this entry level after completing the whole PDEng program.</p>
<h2 id="Design-activities"><a href="#Design-activities" class="headerlink" title="Design activities"></a>Design activities</h2><p>Design is a commonly used term or more precisely an abused word in industry. Any kinds of engineer seems to have an added <em>design</em> in their title even if their working contexts don’t match the design criteria. Design in technology should eventually solve the pain, which is placed in the middle of the problem-solving process. To achieve a solution-aimed design, a design procedure and the involved technique are powerful. You need to start from understanding customer requirements, linking their problem to the technology, showing how your method tackles the problem and finally verifying that the design works. The details in the design phase will be mentioned later.</p>
<h2 id="Project-based-management"><a href="#Project-based-management" class="headerlink" title="Project-based management"></a>Project-based management</h2><p>The problems we encounter in the industry can be downscaled to a monomer level but can also be upscaled to a system level.The complexity does not change the key property of a project that the frustration of a problem determines the project scope. Project is a framework which ramp up people, money, quality and time line to develop a solution. The control flow in a project is another important item to be aware: who are the stakeholders and when to report them. The detail flow will be elaborated in the following series.</p>
<h2 id="Personal-skills"><a href="#Personal-skills" class="headerlink" title="Personal skills"></a>Personal skills</h2><p>You need hard skills to cut off gold but you also need soft skills to get gold in the first place. In a multi-discipline industry, not everyone is on the same page as you is not a fresh news. You would need to explain what you think in a proper manner such that others can interact with your work. Your stakeholders are often too busy to listen to your update or to read your whole report. They just want you to tell what they want to know. You need to convince them your action is on the right direction. Personal skills, like art of presentation, industrial writing and personality reflection will help you on how to do when you are in these circumstances.</p>
<h2 id="Industrial-projects"><a href="#Industrial-projects" class="headerlink" title="Industrial projects"></a>Industrial projects</h2><p>Up to here you have read some terminologies used frequently in the technology filed but none of them will be yours if no practice is done on you. The industrial projects in the PDEng track offers you a chance to practice your learning. When you are involved in a company, you can see how people are busy in their workplace. You will discover there are still some places that they can improve in their process. Your initiative and effort will bring the additional value in the company’s success. The company’s content will be a trigger for your next journey.</p>
<p>In this post I tried to cover the full aspects inside a PDEng program. I will elaborate more on <strong>design</strong>, <strong>project managment</strong> and <strong>personal skill</strong> in the later posts. Thank you for your attention.  </p>

    <title>如何用理解式模型學好英文</title>
    <url>/2020/06/07/Languages/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>我個人覺得語言是非常豐富多元的，但卻也讓人很掙扎到底應該使用哪中語言與他人溝通。同樣在這架設自己網站時，也面連到相同問題，最後我覺得還是以想要觸擊的使用者做依歸。對於科技和專案管理內容，以英文為主，至於海外工作心得則以中文為主。語言的學習是持續並進的，同時必須要有對等興趣作為陪襯才會學得快速。</p>
<h1 id="英文學習"><a href="#英文學習" class="headerlink" title="英文學習"></a>英文學習</h1><p>我想很多人對於如何學習外語，都發表了許多實用的想法。今天我就從理工的角度切入，分析我是如何邁進英文精進之路。首先應該了解到語言涵蓋了聽說讀寫四個部分，四者間的關係與各自對應到的技巧如同下表的關係:</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="聽說"><a href="#聽說" class="headerlink" title="聽說"></a>聽說</h2><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Listening</th>
<th>Speaking</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>1. 重訓: 讓自己習慣英語的語速 <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/60-second-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[60-second science]</a> <ul>1)聽懂大意<br>2)檢視文搞<br>3)重播加速</ul><br>2. 意象: 轉化內容成為腦中的圖像<a href="https://tw.voicetube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[voicetube]</a> <ul>1)簡述內容<br>2)將前述聽到的內容作分段做echoing<br>3)了解整個vedio的內容之後，<br>將其概念愈自己的論述闡明出來<br>4)重播之前的題材幫助自己複習意象</ul><br>3. 廣度: 增進自己在不同話題的聊天性</td>
<td>1. 概念發想: 思考自己想要訴說的概念<br>2. 段落組織: 串聯發展的概念，形成故事線<br>3. 熟悉的表意方式: 尋照自己欣賞說話形式</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>先從聽說來看，左右兩邊代表的是input與output，任何的語言的學習都是進與出的對應，兩者之間想輔相成。對於過去沒有特別習過聽英文的朋友，抓住對話節奏會有上手的困難，通常一開始的起點都會是聽力重訓，讓自己的耳多能習慣這個語言的節奏。練習的方式如同表格所列舉的步驟，從我自己的經驗來看，這個階段大約需要經過一個月，你就會發現自己有能力抓住對話的方向。</p>
<p>當你自己發現已經可以抓住對話的方向，恭喜你已經可以邁向第二個階段了。這個階段是整個聽說模型建立的關鍵，好比你在使用中文和別人溝通時，你會在聽到別人說出一兩句話後，腦中就會開始出現相對應的影像。這樣聲音到意象的轉化也需要被建立在英文溝通上，進而幫助你在口語對話的能力。訓練流程的起步如同第一階段，你可以在voicetube裡面選擇有興趣的教材，在聽過一遍之後，試者將大意表達出來。一開始可能無法表達完整的影片內容，這是正常的。接者開始第二步<code>echo</code>影片內容(這個方法也被稱之為shadowing)，在撥放一句話後，思考自己理解的意象中，重複說出剛剛聽到的對話，如此一來聲音與意象形成連結。當整部影片你都完成這個流程，你可以朝向第三步，將整部影片在重複撥放一片，然後講出裡面的內容，此時你會發現說出來的內容更具深度同時結構也很完整。這個練習並非一朝一夕可以達成的，一部影片可以拆分成幾天來練習，兩三個月之後你會發現你能夠自然地將心中的想法轉化出來。</p>
<p>第三階段就是持之以恆的練習，當你建立了紮實的意象轉化，你就可以開始搜尋其他領域的影片來擴充單字量與慣用語。訓練上相信可以在第一遍時就掌握住大致的內容，然後針對不熟的句型做shadowing即可。半年之後，你會注意自己英語聽說水平明顯的躍昇。</p>
<p>最後關於口說能力，其實已經建構在聽說的模型之中，當你能夠將意象自由的轉化成語言時，這代表了口語已有了一定的基礎，剩下的是如何建立有條理的原創內涵。你所需要做的就是將分別的意象，已故事線的方式串聯起來，讓聽者能夠順者你的思緒來了解你的演講內容。如果你想成為有影響力的人，不妨參考Ted Talks看看有沒有你喜歡的表達方式。</p>
<h2 id="讀寫"><a href="#讀寫" class="headerlink" title="讀寫"></a>讀寫</h2><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Reading</th>
<th>Writing</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>1. 搜尋與分割: 快速的找尋自己所需要的內容 <br>2. 架構判斷對與分析: 解析作者的目的與各段落的功用 <br>3. 寫作風格(style)的臨摹</td>
<td>1. 概念發想 <br>2. 建立組織架構 <br>3. 語法與風格的淬鍊</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>從這裡可以了解到其實讀寫的關係就之於聽說的關係，但看上下去讀寫要練習的反而不多。錯!讀寫的鍛鍊其實比聽說更加困難，真正的寫作是要在第三部份下非常多心思的。從工程與商業的角度來看，主要的需求是在第一與第二部分。你可以想像一下，如果今天你要在很多參考文獻中找出對你目前項目有幫助的資訊，你要做的第一件事就是善用關鍵字找到對應的內容，理解這段資訊在說些什麼，是不是符合自己的需求。</p>
<p>第二部分則是利用架構幫助自己了解掌握這篇文章輸出的概要，在哪裡可以找到自己的需求或是這片文章其實並不符合自己的需求。商業類別的文章不太像理工文獻都會有所謂的目錄，能夠自己解析出文章架構，也會對之後自己寫作有所幫助。常見的文章架構像是敘述、比較與因果，都有很明顯的架構提供辨別。</p>
<p>第三部分的風格含括眾多觀念,，其中3C(cohension, conherence and concision)的概念是埋值得推薦的，能夠讓你的文章內的想法凝於一體。有機會可以臨摹托福閱讀的文章了解一下這些如何敘述一個主題。</p>
<p>最後寫作就是將你的想法帶入適當的架構中，在每個架構下將其展開並搭配適當的風格，讓讀者能循者思維邏輯享受你的內涵。當然前面所講的內容比較偏向正式寫作，如果是與同事間平常的email往來，那就我手寫我口囉!</p>
<h1 id="英文能力整合"><a href="#英文能力整合" class="headerlink" title="英文能力整合"></a>英文能力整合</h1><p>再將學習過程拆分之後，接下來要將個別能力做整合，達到可以得心應手的境界。你可以想像語言的整合就好比腦中存在者太極的運轉，當新的資訊進入從外界進入時，腦中的理解模型將其消化成意象，而這意象友會激發腦中的思考，產生你所說的對話。藉由聆聽native speaker說話的內容，了解他們為何這樣說、如何說以及說些什麼，大腦內的迴路就會被刻劃成型。當下次有相同的情境出現時，你會自然而然的論述你想訴說的概念。寫作與對話的遵循相同的軌跡，只要你能拆分新進的內容，下次寫作時可以運用相同的手法，自身的寫作模式就會更加豐富。</p>

    <title>Towards PDEng-3: Technical Design Validation</title>
    <url>/2020/07/23/PDEng-3/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is the part 2 of the design phase. For people who haven’t seen the part 1, please have a look. This will help you integrate the whole design flow.</p>
<h1 id="Design-analysis-and-development"><a href="#Design-analysis-and-development" class="headerlink" title="Design analysis and development"></a>Design analysis and development</h1><p>In a industrial work flow, there are couple of modules which are involved in a product/solution design. A complete design requires not only generating ideas but also verifying that idea as a workable solution. How do we evaluate if our idea works as we expected? You need to establish some sorts of experiments in which a clear analysis proves your point. Therefore, engineering statistics steps in into your experiments, which guides you what to do and how to analyze the results. A useful websites named <a href="https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engineering statistics handbook</a> offers a completely overview for the experimental problems your will encounter in the engineering field. These problems can be categorized into several modules which are exploration, measure, characterize… etc. If any of them fit your current problem, have a look in the details. When you look into each category, you will notice that the approaches used in different categories are very similar because they were originated from the fundamental statics methods, such as data exploration, regression, variance analysis and design of experiments, for which another <a href="https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online course website</a> is recommended to guide you step by step on understanding these statistics methods. In this post I will focus pretty much on the usage of design of experiment and design for six sigma and how these methods are incorporated into the design flow.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="Design-of-Experiments-DoE"><a href="#Design-of-Experiments-DoE" class="headerlink" title="Design of Experiments(DoE)"></a>Design of Experiments(DoE)</h2><p>DoE is a quite powerful skills in the data analysis. The fundamental concept is to tune the input parameters in an organized sequence such that the effect of each parameters in a process/model is known. Once the effect of each parameters is identified, we can know which parameters give the most dominant effect and use the DoE model to search for an optimized design.<br>Think about our nice egg exercise. Assuming in the previous modeling exercise the recipe has been generated as the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>put an egg in 200 degC water for 10 minutes and cool down the egg in the room temp 25 degC for 5 minutes </li>
<li>put the egg back to the 80 degC water for 5 minutes, then a soft-boiled egg is made.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you get a chance to test your recipe. What kind of experiments should I do? how to use the results to convince my stakeholders to accept this recipe? The experiments that you can run could have the following flow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up the objective of an experiment. In this case the objective is the temperature of the yolk. The yolk temperature should be well controlled such that it can still maintain liquid. </li>
<li>Determine a sampling plan for the design parameters. There are five parameters in this recipe, the first water temperature, the cooking time, the first cooling time, the second water temperature and the cooking time. We should set up an experiment to vary each of them one by one in order to know their effects.</li>
<li>Run the experiments and enter the result into the DoE software like Minitab or R to see what the effect of these parameters are.</li>
</ol>
<p>the expected outcome for this experiment would look like the following graph. We see that the most critical factors are the heating temperatures in those two steps. The cooling time has a non-linear effect to the final temperature. For the rest the impact is very limited. Therefore, you would need to well control these two factors, temp1 and temp2. The reason why multiple levels of a factor are taken into account is to cover the discrepancy of the simulation and the reality for these physical quantity and to understand the sensitivity of each factor.</p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_DoE_example.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Design-for-Six-Sigma-DfSS"><a href="#Design-for-Six-Sigma-DfSS" class="headerlink" title="Design for Six Sigma(DfSS)"></a>Design for Six Sigma(DfSS)</h2><p>DfSS is a training which helps you to be familiar with the other common static methods used in the design analysis. These tooling are linked to the problems, such as process capability and stability, measurement system evaluation, design of experiments and reliability. The DoE method has been covered in the previous section. This section I would like to explain how to incorporate process capability in the design analysis.</p>
<p>So far I believe you have been pretty familiar with the recipe of cooking soft-boiled eggs. You have a good understanding about the recipe both in simulation and in experiment. What is still missing in the last mile? You need to show this recipe is capable of being used in the production environment (other restaurant staff are capable of making a successful soft-boiled egg using this recipe). Therefore, the last experiment you will do is to ask your colleague to cook soft-boiled eggs with this recipe and calculate what the Cpk value is.</p>
<p>The experiment could be done in this way: 1) cook at least five eggs per day with your recipe and measure the yolk temperature. 2) keep doing this for consecutive 25 days. The data will be a 25 by 5 dataframe. You can use X chart and R chart to analyze the temperature mean and range variation during these 25 days. There are some rules that a stable process need to comply with in the control charts. In our test case, all the data are within the control limit, meaning that the data itself has no extreme outliers.      </p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_controlchart_example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Since there is no strange data in our dataset, we can continue the process capability analysis. In the previous section, we said that a good soft boiled egg should have yolk temperature around 80 degC. This number is our target, and we can accept +/- 5 degC variation in our product. According to this specification and our data, our recipe has the Cpk value 0.26, which actually suggest that this recipe is not capable of making a successful soft boiled egg in the production (typically Cpk value should be greater than 1.33). The main problem indicated the capability is the offset of mean which makes the whole distribution shift towards the left. We should try to find in which recipe step there was an added heat source. Besides, the temperature and cool time control in the process can still be improved to reduce the temperature variation. </p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_capability_example.png" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>In this series I explained what the verification role of design analysis and development is in the design phase. Two useful statistic methods were introduced, DoE and DfSS, which help you to know how to incorporate them into the design analysis. Linking to the previous series, <strong>Modelling</strong>, <strong>DMD</strong> and <strong>DAD</strong> together are the miniature of the design workflow. Although I used a simple toy case to demonstrate these concepts, they are scalable to the industrial work with different domain contents included.</p>

    <title>Towards PDEng-4: Project Management</title>
    <url>/2020/08/23/PDEng-4/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Often time we heard project project… floating around in the daily conversation. What exactly is a project and what people actually do in project management? These questions will be answered in this series. First, project is a collection of planed work that needs to be done in order to achieve a defined goal. The goal and the result of the project should be agreed with customers. If one would like to position the role of projects together with improvisation and routine, the table below shows the comparison among these three. In addition to the predictability of the result and the duration of work, the interesting thing is that commitment is also a feature which differentiates one from another. For any project, we must commit the result with customers and the result needs to be recognized by customers. </p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Improvisation</th>
<th>Project</th>

<tbody><tr>
<td>1. unknown result <br>2. short term <br>3. commitment to the work</td>
<td>1. part of the result is known <br> 2. long term <br> 3. commitment to the result</td>

</tbody></table>
<a id="more"></a>
<h1 id="Project-pyramid"><a href="#Project-pyramid" class="headerlink" title="Project pyramid"></a>Project pyramid</h1><p><img src="/img/PDEng_project_pyramid.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Project-result"><a href="#Project-result" class="headerlink" title="Project result"></a>Project result</h2><p>When we start to propose a project to a customer, it should comprise several important elements which reside in the project pyramid. The first important element is the project result. For any type of project that you start to work on, a clear definition for what project result should be delivered is crucial. How do we arrive to the project result?<br>Well, a very good approach is to start from the customer background. From there you will know what their business is aiming for, what the challenges they are facing now, and eventually why they need this result. One more thing that should be included in the project result as well is what not to be delivered, which defines the project boundary. With the above information in a document a clear project definition is ready.  </p>
<h2 id="Activity-plan"><a href="#Activity-plan" class="headerlink" title="Activity plan"></a>Activity plan</h2><p>The second element in the pyramid is the activity/phasing plan. When a project starts, there are several phases that will be gone through. The first one is the initiation phase in which customers and the relevant parties should be involved. The goal of the initiation phase is to make sure that everyone involved in the project shares the same view for the project size, what should be delivered and what not be delivered. The activities in this phase can be to investigate the overall and sub-goals, to decide if any preliminary study is required and to prepare the project documents. </p>
<p>When the initiation phase is clear, the next phase is the definition phase in which the specifications based on the project result should be consolidated. These specifications can be following requirements: </p>
<ul>
<li>the <em>working conditions</em> under which the product and the solution should be capable of working on</li>
<li>the <em>functional demands</em> that the product/solution should cover</li>
<li>the <em>operational demands</em> that the product/solution can provide to users</li>
</ul>
<p>From these demands, the work structure can be laid out in which several project activities can support each demand and link their relations with each other. These activities will be detailed in the design phase where people need to search for the design/solution to meet the demands. The outcome from the design phase should be the approved design. </p>
<p>With those design and solution in hands, we can proceed to prepare them. In this phase the activities will need to engage with the suppliers and the third parties to make sure that you will have their deliverables before execution.  Furthermore, instructing those who will execute the realization is another important activity.</p>
<p>Realization is finally the last mile towards the project result. keep your eyes on the execution and make sure the project is on track. Taking some time to prepare the technical documents for review is extremely important. If there are any customer feedbacks and wishes for maintenance or continuation, keep these activities in the follow up phase.</p>
<h2 id="Control-plan"><a href="#Control-plan" class="headerlink" title="Control plan"></a>Control plan</h2><p>The third element in a project is the control plan. Control plan is like a regulator which wires up the activities between and within phases. It would be hard to imagine what would happen if there is no control plan to regulate huge amount of activities in a project. Typically these controls are time, money, quality, information and organization. </p>
<p><strong>Time</strong> is a common factor in a plan in which all the tasks follows the time line. These tasks can be executed in sequence or in parallel. The critical actions of time control are:</p>
<ul>
<li>put expected time and margin on each task</li>
<li>indicate when the milestone would be expected and update</li>
<li>leave additional time for backup if deviation occurs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Money</strong> is the second factor which is as important as time. You will need to have the similar actions as shown in time control:</p>
<ul>
<li>estimate the cost and margin in each phase</li>
<li>know who can authorize the cost and when should update the overall cost</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quality</strong> is the third factor that should be included in the control loop. You should think about how to translate the progress of activities into how far we are to the demands and where should be the checking points to plan the reviews internally and externally. who should be involved in the review to secure the quality of the activity outcome. In such as way the ongoing project direction can be tracked and guided. </p>
<p><strong>Information</strong> is the fourth control factor. You need to update the progress of project to the stakeholders regularly. If there is any unexpected changes occurring, an update to the stakeholders is necessary. The following list can help you prepare the update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who produces the documents</li>
<li>Who get the information and who approves the information</li>
<li>How to deliver the information</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Organization</strong> is the final one in the control loop, which is related to the participants and parties. Based on the previous planned activities, it is time to place people and teams in these activities and show their responsibilities. Don’t forget the third parties such as suppliers and consultants in the control loop. The RACI model can help you identify their roles and responsibilities. If any team member is joining or leaving, or the task is transferring, the RACI table should be updated as well.</p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_project_RACI.png" alt=""><br>In the RACI table, it is suggested to assign only one “R” to each task in order to reduce ambiguity in a project and enhance working efficiency. “A” is the role who can authorize “R “ for go or no go decision.  </p>
<h2 id="Risk-analysis"><a href="#Risk-analysis" class="headerlink" title="Risk analysis"></a>Risk analysis</h2><p>Every project has its potential risks. If we can know them upfront, we can prepare the mitigation plan to reduce the impact of these risks. In general it is to good to have a brain storming session with the project team members to list what risk the team will encounter and make a table to evaluate the priority of each of them by taking probability and severity into account (You can reuse the risk analysis approach shown in the <a href="/2020/07/21/PDEng-2/" title="PDEng series-2">PDEng series-2</a>)</p>
<p>The options to diminish the risk with an action plan could be these four:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the plan to avoid the risk</li>
<li>Prepare a contingency plan for the risk, also known as “plan B”</li>
<li>Deflect the risk to another party</li>
<li>Accept the risk and do nothing</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>Project-based management is a frame work which requires some patience because the project plan will be modified several times when it is executed in the field. Understanding the overall project structure can help you adapt to the changes easily. </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>想了許久或許是機緣已到，就決定開站了。很多人或許還在躊躇怎樣的開始，但對我而言做下去一切就會明瞭了。這個blog的目的就是希望能將自己過去的走跳經歷與想法分享出來，讓更多人能夠一起參與回響，期望下個美好科技時代的來臨。</p>
<p>回顧自己當初的選擇，這的確是個意外的啟發。這個啟發來自於同期預官室友的認真，讓本來沒有特別想要在國外闖蕩的自己重新思考這是否會是一個選項。當下的夜晚，開始在茫茫的網路上尋找自己下步該往哪去。一個倏忽即逝的片段在腦海中閃過，想起了曾經被告知的專業博士，新的旅程似乎又有再次開啟的跡象。</p>
<p>專業博士(PDEng)是近年歐洲興起的概念，源自於產學合作的發想，最終導引到產業的轉變與進步。對那個時候的我這是三個選項的其中一個，另外我也同時考慮了博士(phD)與工作的選項，以下就針對這三個做比較:</p>

    <title>Towards PDEng-6: Understand yourself and others</title>
    <url>/2020/09/21/PDEng-6/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Do you believe that you are unique in the world? Do you truly know who you are? In today’s collaborative society we are not only busy with our own tasks but also at some point we need to team up with other members in order to grow up and to achieve success. You might have a list of people you are in favor of within an organization and perhaps also a black list of people you don’t like. But what if you have no choice but to work with unfavored people, how to ensure a peaceful working relations? In this post I would like to guide you on knowing who you are in a <strong>learning cycle</strong>, how to keep good <strong>communication</strong> with others, how to give other <strong>feedback</strong>, and most importantly how to maintain good <strong>working relations</strong> based on who you are. Before we deeply dive into some soft skills, let’s first explore ourselves.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h1 id="Learning-cycle"><a href="#Learning-cycle" class="headerlink" title="Learning cycle"></a>Learning cycle</h1><p>Below the graph shows the learning cycle of human beings. What do you think where you are in the cycle? Some people think they are theorists while others think they are pragmatists. Take me for example, I recognize that I have a mixed type of theorist and pragmatist spirit, meaning that I like to think about the overall structure before I start to work on a topic. I like to have a system level overview to know why I need to do this work. After I thought about the general flow, I like to realize it to see if it works as expected. However, if somebody just asked me to do a work without thinking further ahead, it would be difficult to motivate me to execute that action. The purpose of identifying yourself in a learning cycle is to notice what your future development can be. The actions can be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the most suitable position to boost your growth. In other words, you should search for the position which matches your native mode. This way you can maximize the potential. </li>
<li>Be aware of your pitfalls when you are in the native mode. For example, sometimes theorists over think the problems without putting them in actions. In the end this has a risk to deliver the outcome on time.  </li>
<li>Try to play different roles if there is a chance coming. There will be different roles that you will see in your career path. If you want to broaden your view, experiencing these different roles definitely helps. However, not all of these roles would perfectly match your natural mode. Therefore, picking up that missing spirit to close the gap is something worth learning. </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_selfreflection_learningcycle.png" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="Communication"><a href="#Communication" class="headerlink" title="Communication"></a>Communication</h1><p>Have you ever experienced one thing that when you are saying A but your colleagues answer you in B? Or when you are trying to explain what your point is on this issue, he still gets stocked to understand you correctly. If you have seen these many times, then “yes” you just suffered from the communication problems. If you see the picture below, you know the communication itself is just a coding and decoding process. How to ensure you understand and they can understand you as well? The approach I can share with you is <strong>LSD</strong> which stands for the three following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen: When someone is saying their opinions, try not to interrupt their speaking. The same holds the other way around. If your colleague just interrupted you, ask him to first let your finish your statement.</li>
<li>Summarize: Try to summarize what other people’s statement to make sure your interpretation is in line with his thought.</li>
<li>Dig deeper: When there is any confusion between your conversation, do not hesitate to ask any question to clarify what they just meant.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_selfreflection_communication.png" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="Feedback"><a href="#Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Feedback"></a>Feedback</h1><p>When you are working in an organization, have you ever noticed that some colleagues’ behaviors bring benefits to an organization while some of them bring disadvantages to you and the organization. Is there any way that we can shape our working environment towards a positive and competitive one?. Perhaps it is time to give feedbacks to the people around you. Giving feedback is an art, namely, we should not destroy the working relations between each other due to feedback. Here are some remarks when you are about to give feedbacks.</p>
<ul>
<li>make your statement descriptive not qualifications. Try to describe your perceptions.</li>
<li>link your perception to a specific situation and behavior. Focus your perceptions on the situation and the behavior, not the person itself.</li>
<li>select neutral words for the description.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, feedback is not only one way but can also come from the other way. When you receive the feedback from others, perhaps these remarks can help you digest other people’s gift better.</p>
<ul>
<li>listen carefully and summarize. The purpose is to understand their feedback correctly. If needed, you can also ask questions to clarify the part which is unclear for you.</li>
<li>accept the present and no defense. This way you show you will take this seriously.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might ask why we need to accept feedbacks and how the feedback will help us? The graph below is a matrix which is how you know about yourself and how other people know about you. Feedback is a gift which enables us to unlock our potential. As we are human beings, sometimes we will not see our blind points. If others can point it out, you will recognize it and develop that potential afterwards. On the other hands, self revelation is a direction in which you show people your ability and competence. This direction can make you more visible in an organization and therefore you will have more chance in the future. If you can successfully develop your blind spots and make them visible to others, you do not only gain this competence yourself but also give the impression you have unlimited potential to invest in, making your career more successful. </p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_selfreflection_feedback.png" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="Good-working-relations"><a href="#Good-working-relations" class="headerlink" title="Good working relations"></a>Good working relations</h1><p>In an organization we all have to drive our own business values to success. Under this process we should realized that We have different interests, values and needs with some people or groups, which could sometimes cause conflicts with other people. How good the working relations you can create depends on how you handle the conflict with others. Your attitude could result in the five scenarios as described in the figure below. If we always force the direction towards only to our side, perhaps the conflict will still come back with even larger amplitude. For ourselves, it is not acceptable to only sacrifice our interests for a long period time because this will only lead to frustration on the work. Since we are smart people we know that we should maximize the benefit on both sides. However, what are the tips that we can follow to realized a win-win outcome?</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, you need build up confidence and trust. You should be honest about what is important for you and understand what is the importance for others. In other words, not to exaggerate what both sides actually need. Otherwise, distrust can be the obstacle to block your communication.</li>
<li>Secondly, be creative to find the connection between two sides and think about how the differences can be addressed.</li>
<li>Thirdly, make good use of the communication skills you just learned</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course you need a mirror to reflect what your current altitude is for solving these conflicts. Some questionnaires would help you to achieve this. Please feel free to search for them online.</p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_selfreflection_workrelation.png" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>In this post I have mentioned several topics related to your soft skills. These soft skills are very generic but very important in a group because success is not evaluated on a single person but on the whole unit. If you would like to have smooth career path, you might need to join some really hands-on trainings to practice these soft skills. For people who are interested more on the personality analysis and collaboration, MBTI type indicator is a good methodology to look into.</p>

    <title>Towards PDEng-2: Technical Design Initialization</title>
    <url>/2020/07/21/PDEng-2/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>As the overview shown in the series-1, design is a key activity in the PDEng track. I would like address what <strong>Design</strong> is in this post. Throughout history competitive companies are always looking into innovations to improve their business line. A schematic flow can simply explain how innovation works from the beginning to the end. </p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_innovation_process.png" alt=""><br>A company typically starts to find its own unsatisfaction from either its product performance, development cycle or manufacturing process. They need to understand why the problems are there. The problem can be things like defects in a product, bottleneck in the development cycle or bugs in a manufacturing process. Some of them can be found in a simple diagnosis, and others might need extensive research to understand the phenomenon. These are all in the discovery phase. The design phase can start when the problems are concrete. There are some powerful techniques, such as <strong>Modeling</strong>, <strong>Design Method for Development(DMD)</strong> and <strong>Design analysis</strong>, which will be introduced later to help the design process. After a solution is generated from the design phase, we can deliver it to the deployment phase in most marketing activities are involved. Design is clearly an inter-link between the problem and the end user. </p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h1 id="Modeling"><a href="#Modeling" class="headerlink" title="Modeling"></a>Modeling</h1><p>Modeling is a quite basic necessity in the design process. You need to have a model to represent the problem and with the model to demonstrate your solution is able to tackle the issue. A model can be as simple as a mathematic equation which only describe the relation between the input and the output. This model can further extended to a complex one which requires strong computation to tell you the the answer. For example, if a chef comes to you asking how he can cook a perfect boiled egg, you actually take this as a modeling exercise to propose a recipe to him. </p>
<p>Let’s start from a sketch to illustrate this problem. The picture shows a egg profile in 2D and specify the conditions which can meet the criteria of a perfect boiled egg. The model used in the boiled egg is the thermal equation. The important output from this model is the temperature distribution after a certain time. Depending on the procedure in the cooking process, the given input to this model will be different which leads to a different temperature distribution in space. To compute the outcome of this model, we usually run the FEM(Finite Element method) simulation using software like <a href="https://www.comsol.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COMSOL</a>, but we can still do a back-of-envelope calculation to check if the simulation make sense or not. </p>
<p>In the 1D equation show in the figure below, it is straightforward to understand that the temperature of yolk after a certain time can be calculated from the initial medium temperature and distance between the contact point the surface of Yolk. Since the egg shape is an ellipse, it make sense to know that the temperature of the yolk along the short side and along the long side will be equal. You would need some special tricks to have uniform temperature distribution inside the entire egg.  </p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_modeling_example.png" alt=""><br><img src="/img/PDEng_modeling_equations.png" alt=""><br>The final recipe is involving several steps to make a perfect boiled egg which is out of the scope in this post. You should realize that any technical design problem can benefit from modeling. For the industrial project I have worked for, such as optical thin-film scattering, glass thermal process and the fancy AR glass, they all require modeling and yet even more than one model in a use case.</p>
<h1 id="DMD-Design-Method-for-Development"><a href="#DMD-Design-Method-for-Development" class="headerlink" title="DMD(Design Method for Development)"></a>DMD(Design Method for Development)</h1><p>When you receive a task, you usually receive a problem statement rather than a physical requirement. Multiple people are interested in your work. In this circumstance how are you going to manage their expectations? The first thing you need to do is to consolidate the problem statement to the customer requirements(demanding quality). These customer requirements can be further translated to the function requirements which are the technique area you plan to investigate. After you know what areas should be involved in your solution and what risk you will encounter, you are ready to discuss your thought with the stakeholders. Several useful tooling are introduced to assist you to manage the design flow.</p>
<h2 id="Stakeholder-chart"><a href="#Stakeholder-chart" class="headerlink" title="Stakeholder chart"></a>Stakeholder chart</h2><p>Design somehow is not a pure technical activity. Oftentimes it seems that people involved in the design process influence your work and design direction. Therefore, we need to mange our stakeholders’ expectation. stakeholder chart helps put your stakeholder into four categories which are clarified by importance and enthusiasm. Let me use my boiled egg as an example here. When you design a recipe to make a soft boiled egg, who do you think should be involved? The chef, the restaurant owner and customers, these people are called stakeholders in your design process. If we score them according to their roles, we will see a graph like below. You see that the chef is a quite significant stakeholder because the new recipe is interesting for him and has the strong impact on his menu. The restaurant owner seems also a key stakeholder in your work because he has the strongest influence on whether you would be able to keep developing this new recipe. Therefore, the recommend action from this chart is to suggest work closely with the chief and involve the restaurant owner for help if needed. For the rest, you can keep them informed for the progress.<br><img src="/img/PDEng_DMD_stakeholders.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="House-of-quality"><a href="#House-of-quality" class="headerlink" title="House of quality"></a>House of quality</h2><p>Typically after a problem statement has been consolidated to customer requirements, they are more than one you need consider.House of quality provides you with an overview of what the technical area you want to cover and how they relate to the customer requirements. Again the egg exercise is an example here. When a chef ask you to make a recipe for a soft boiled egg, this has already been one of the requirements; however, the restaurant owner could add his wishes to this recipe that the new recipe should take less than 1hr in the cooking time and can prepare at least 20 soft-boiled egg in each batch. With all these wishes, you can draw a house of quality diagram like this: the bottom left part is the customer requirements, and the top part is the functional requirements in which you will investigate to figure out the solution. Since you need to have a soft boiled egg within a limit amount of time, it make sense to investigate the thermal process control and the cooker capability. </p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_DMD_housequality.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Failure-mode-and-effect-analysis-FMEA"><a href="#Failure-mode-and-effect-analysis-FMEA" class="headerlink" title="Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA)"></a>Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA)</h2><p>Design discussion should not only focus on what the requirements are and how the design goes but also not forget the risk analysis. Risk are those unwilling failure mode you will encounter in a design project and they would have different level of effect to the project. Monitoring those critical risks every month in the design process are necessary. Let me start from the FEMA table to see how we get those critical risk in the soft-boiled egg case. As we have already summarized the required function requirements in the house of quality, it is easy to think what the potential failure mode from each individual item. </p>
<p>For the thermal process, the potential failure mode can the non-realistic recipe generated from your modeling. The effect of this failure mode will severe because no soft-boiled egg can be produced by this recipe. Therefore, the action plan is to involve the chef to decide what is the acceptable cooking procedure in the kitchen. The other risk can be shortage of the egg that you simulated due to the chicken flue or other reasons. The action plan is to cover the tolerance of the egg in the simulation or to secure the supply channel of that particular type of egg. For the utility capability, there might be a chance that the utility we have or buy does not give the performance as we expected, which cause the problem of prepare soft-boiled egg in a large batch. We can mitigate this mis-expectation by doing the measurement for the utility performance first. After we combine the severity and the probability of the failure modes, we notice that main concern in this exercise is the recipe feasibility. With the proposed control action, None of the is risk should be worried. </p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_DMD_FMEAtable.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The DMD flow is a quantitative approach which governs the design work. The example we use here is just a simple use case but it pretty much demonstrates the value. In the industrial work the items in the list usually multiply, that is the reason why a quantitative approach will help you have a fair judgement.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>Technical design is a flow which aims to solve problems. It is not only a technical activities but with business awareness included. The starting point of technical design is customer requirements. Using the methods mentioned in this post can help you translate and manage customer requirements in your design.  </p>

    <title>Towards PDEng-5: How to present your ideas?</title>
    <url>/2020/09/07/PDEng-5/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>If you have stayed in the technical industry for many years, you might hear this quote sometimes “We are always good at being a technical expert but we somehow need to sell our ideas to customers”. The technical industry is a business-based environment where any person who wants to realize its own marvelous idea needs to get approved by the market. How do we prepare ourselves to be ready for this demand? Do we have enough personal skills to convince our customers to accept the ideas? </p>
<p>Think about a situation where you were asked to give a presentation about your new technical findings tomorrow. You know that some major customers who come from different level sit under the stage waiting for your story. What the story are you going design such that they will follow your thought? How do you present your story such that customers will not get bored by your presentation? In this post I am going to show theatrical approaches which will help you communicate with your audience and construct the storyline.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h1 id="Art-of-presenting-science"><a href="#Art-of-presenting-science" class="headerlink" title="Art of presenting science"></a>Art of presenting science</h1><h2 id="Communication-in-theater-settings"><a href="#Communication-in-theater-settings" class="headerlink" title="Communication in theater settings"></a>Communication in theater settings</h2><p>Everyone basically knew how to talk to people when they were young. You must have had the chance to describe any of you idea to your classmates in schools but it seems that that kind of experience is not useful when it comes to business presentation. What cause the difference between the daily conversion and the presentation? Let’s start from identifying the basic elements which are included in our normal conversation. When you want to say something to people around you, you first notice that you have some sort of ideas and emotions inside your brain, for instance, you want to urge your friend to speed up because you are likely to miss the bus. You will move your head back to your friends and say “Hurry up!” with impatience. The message in the brain just took the body movement and the intonation to come out. This actually means that content and emotions need channels to slide to the audience. If your fiend is really aware of time, he will react to you immediately. An interactive communication just started. </p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_presentation_communication.png" alt=""><br>Let’s move the scenario back to the presentation. It seems like a familiar situation where you have to deliver message to the audience but now the distance between you and your audience is three times longer than normal. Furthermore, the audience may not be actively involved in your content. The first issue <em>distance</em> can be tackled by exaggerating the communication channels three times larger such that you are able to reach your audience. The second issue will partially be covered by exaggeration and could be completely addressed by the storyline. If we see these communications channels, almost all of them are strongly linked to emotion, which means your emotion can trigger the change of these channels. For example, if you are saying something which is really important, you could slow down the tempo, show a serious facial expression and lower the intonation, which can attract the audience attention that you are saying something significant. If you are listing how many achievement you made in this design, do not hesitate to use your gesture to count them and give the eye contact to the audience, this way you show your confidence to them. There are quite many channel sets I can make here for different scenarios but this will lead to a very long post. The rule of thumb of using theater settings is to observe how actors perform in theaters under such scenario, and try to project their way of communication to the presentation. I believe this way of presenting can make your presentation more attractive and powerful.    </p>
<h2 id="Constructing-storyline"><a href="#Constructing-storyline" class="headerlink" title="Constructing storyline"></a>Constructing storyline</h2><h3 id="Why-stories"><a href="#Why-stories" class="headerlink" title="Why stories"></a>Why stories</h3><p>I just briefly touched the point of the theatrical approach which is used to emphasize your emotion to reach the audience. Still we would like to keep our audience’s attention and make sure they can stay with our journey until the end. As human beings we know that we like stories because we could emerge ourselves to the story to feel what the adventure the characters are experiencing. we could attract our audience with a similar approach that is creating a well-structured story in the presentation. Let’s first explore what the basic elements a attractive story should have.</p>
<p>Stories are about people. Think about the time when we read a story, what is the first thing we are looking for? the <strong>character</strong>. characters will generate <strong>actions</strong> which make the story vivid. When we see the characters carry on these actions, what will trigger us to keep an eye on is the <strong>adventure</strong>. Only exciting stories can attract viewer’s eyes. But since we like to experience adventures in a safer environment, we also hope the character can manage <strong>danger</strong> in their journey. There will be a certain period that the characters need to wait until the they come up with a <strong>solution</strong>. The bold parts I just labeled are the basic element that should be included a good story. If I would summarized what a good story is in a single word, that is conflict:</p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_presentation_storyelement.png" alt=""><br>Only when people want to do something but are unsure whether they could succeed could really triggers tension. Audience will be curious about the ending.</p>
<h3 id="Story-phases"><a href="#Story-phases" class="headerlink" title="Story phases"></a>Story phases</h3><p>To create a story with conflict, a useful story phasing is introduced in the picture below. The first phase is the <strong>exposition</strong> where you would describe your main characters and the background of this story. Without the exposition people cannot identify the character and will not worry about the conflict in the story. In other words, they cannot catch you. Another aspect in the exposition is to control the size of the story. If you have a short story, like only one improvement in your study, then make a small world such that people can focus on the conflict you encounter later. If you have a large story, for instance, several milestones have been achieved in your project, you should create a larger world to ensure those conflicts have the room to flourish. Exposition does not need to cover any conflict. It is a preparation state for the motorical moment.</p>
<p><strong>Motorical moment</strong> is the event moment when you reveal the conflicts. The conflict should give people anxiety, which make people want to see how it continues. The conflict should not be too simple to be negligible but also not too huge to kill the audience’s expectation. </p>
<p>After revealing the conflict in the motorical moment, you start to take actions in the <strong>Divergent action phase</strong>. As previously described in the motorical moment, your audience has already expected that the conflict is challenging. Therefore, you will not immediately discover the solution in this phase. You will first take some actions which lead you away from the solution, or these actions may even guide you to the wrong direction, which cause the excitement and tension in the audience sensation. These divergent actions for scientific stories can be the realization of some initial ideas which did not work out in the end. The purpose of showing this experience until the crucial event coming is to confirm the challenge you set in the story.</p>
<p>The crucial event is the moment when something happens which makes the solution of conflict possible. After this event your actions will be redirected to the right direction which goes to the solution. Remember the crucial event is very short and distinguishable. It can just be an insight or thought which dramatically changes the direction of the story.</p>
<p><strong>Convergent action phase</strong> is following the crucial event, which covers the activities pointing towards the solution. In this phase you can arrange faster tempo which shows confidence to audience that we are on the way to the solution. In the end they see the <strong>Solution</strong>.</p>
<p>After you have solved the conflict in the solution phase, there is still one more phase called <strong>Coda</strong> where you can make sure there is nothing happened after the solution phase. The statement can be every one is happy with the result or stakeholder is satisfied with the finding. It is an indication for the audience to notice that this is the end of the story.</p>
<p><img src="/img/PDEng_presentation_storyphases.png" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>In this post I have already introduced what theatrical approaches are and how to use them to address your presentation. Of course, nothing will be more beneficial than a hands-on practicing. After you see this approach, you should try to do some pitfall trainings on your presentation. Writing a story line before practicing can give you more feeling about what you want to say in the presentation. If you are interested in to get some feedback, perhaps I can give some guidance on it.</p>
